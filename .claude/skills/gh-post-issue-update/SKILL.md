## Best Practices

1. **Be Concise**: Focus on actionable information
2. **Use Structure**: Headers and lists improve readability
3. **Include Context**: Future readers need to understand decisions
4. **Link Related Items**: Reference PRs, other issues, commits
5. **Update Regularly**: Don't wait until completion

## Using Body Files

For complex content with special characters:

```bash
# Create temp file
cat > /tmp/update.md << 'EOF'
## Update

Complex content with `code` and special chars...
EOF

# Post using file
gh issue comment <number> --body-file /tmp/update.md

# Clean up
rm /tmp/update.md
```

## Error Handling

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Issue locked | Contact maintainer or use PR comments |
| Rate limited | Wait and retry |
| Auth error | Run `gh auth status` |
| Content too long | Split into multiple comments |
