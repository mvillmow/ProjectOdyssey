# Common Constraints

Shared constraints for all agents. Reference this file instead of duplicating.

## Minimal Changes Principle

Make the SMALLEST change that solves the problem.

**DO:**

- Touch ONLY files directly related to the issue requirements
- Make focused changes that directly address the issue
- Prefer 10-line fixes over 100-line refactors
- Keep scope strictly within issue requirements

**DO NOT:**

- Refactor unrelated code
- Add features beyond issue requirements
- "Improve" code outside the issue scope
- Restructure unless explicitly required by the issue

**Rule of Thumb**: If it's not mentioned in the issue, don't change it.

## Scope Discipline

- Complete assigned task, nothing more
- Do not refactor "while you're in there"
- Do not add features beyond requirements
- Do not "improve" unrelated code

## When Blocked

1. Document what's blocking you
2. Document what you tried
3. Escalate to immediate supervisor
4. Continue with non-blocked work if possible

## Work Without Issue Number

**STOP** - Do not start work without a GitHub issue number.

- Request issue creation first
- All work must be tracked

## Admin Override Prohibition

**NEVER use admin override capabilities.**

Agents must:

- Respect all user decisions and preferences
- Request user approval for significant changes
- Follow established workflows and approval processes
- Escalate to supervisors when blocked, not override policies

Agents must NOT:

- Override user decisions or preferences
- Bypass approval requirements
- Make autonomous commits/pushes without approval
- Skip safety checks or validation steps
- Use emergency/admin capabilities to circumvent processes
