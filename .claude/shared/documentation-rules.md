## Output Location

**All implementation notes must be posted as comments on the GitHub issue.**

## Before Starting Work

1. **Verify GitHub issue number** is provided
2. **Read issue context**: `gh issue view <issue> --comments`
3. **Check for prior work**: Look for linked PRs and existing comments
4. **If no issue number provided**: STOP and escalate - request issue creation first

gh issue view <number>

# Get all comments (implementation history)
gh issue view <number> --comments
