"""
Training Metrics

Metric implementations for tracking training and evaluation performance.

Includes:
- Accuracy (Classification accuracy)
- LossTracker (Loss tracking and averaging)
- ConfusionMatrix (Confusion matrix for classification)
- Precision (Precision metric)
- Recall (Recall metric)

All metrics implement the Metric trait for consistent interface.
