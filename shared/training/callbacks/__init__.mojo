Callback implementations for training loop customization and monitoring.

Includes:
- EarlyStopping (Early stopping based on metrics)
- ModelCheckpoint (Save model checkpoints during training)
- CSVLogger (Log training metrics to CSV)
- LRScheduler (Learning rate scheduler callback)

All callbacks implement the Callback trait for consistent interface.
