"""Text transformation and augmentation utilities.

This module provides transformations for augmenting text data for NLP tasks
Implements basic word-level augmentations including synonym replacement,
random insertion, random swap, and random deletion.

All Random* text transforms use RandomTransformBase for probability handling

Limitations:
- Basic word-level operations (split on spaces)
- English-centric approach
- Simple synonym dictionary (not semantic embeddings)
- May produce ungrammatical text
- No advanced NLP features
