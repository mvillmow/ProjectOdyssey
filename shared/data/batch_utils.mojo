    """Extract a mini-batch from a dataset tensor using zero-copy slicing.

    Extracts a contiguous slice of samples from the dataset starting at
    start_idx and containing up to batch_size samples. Uses ExTensor's
    slice() method for efficient memory views instead of copying data.

    Args:
        data: Full dataset tensor of shape (N, ...) where N is number of samples.
        start_idx: Starting index for batch extraction (0-indexed).
        batch_size: Number of samples to extract.

    Returns:
        Batch tensor of shape (actual_batch_size, ...) where actual_batch_size
        is min(batch_size, N - start_idx). Returns a view that shares memory
        with the original tensor (no copy).

    Raises:
        Error: If start_idx is out of bounds.

    Example:
        ```mojo
        from shared.data import extract_batch

        # Extract batch of 128 images from dataset (zero-copy view)
        var images = load_dataset()  # Shape: (50000, 3, 32, 32)

        # batch shape: (128, 3, 32, 32) - memory shared with images
        ```

    Performance:
        - O(1) time complexity (no data copying)
        - Zero memory allocation for batch extraction
        - Ideal for training loops processing hundreds/thousands of batches
        - Memory is shared until a batch is modified or freed

    Note:
        - Handles edge cases where remaining samples < batch_size
        - Works with any tensor dimensionality (2D, 3D, 4D, etc.)
        - Uses memory-efficient slicing with reference counting
        - Original tensor must remain valid while batch is in use

    Convenience function that extracts matching slices from both data and

        start_idx: Starting index for batch extraction (0-indexed).
        batch_size: Number of samples to extract.

    Returns:
        Tuple of (batch_data, batch_labels) with matching first dimension.
        Both are views that share memory with the original tensors.

    Raises:
