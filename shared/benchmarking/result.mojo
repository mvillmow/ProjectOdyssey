"""Consolidated benchmark result tracking with statistics computation.

This module provides the BenchmarkResult struct for tracking individual
iteration timings and computing statistical metrics (mean, standard deviation,
min, max) for benchmarked operations.

The struct is designed for low-level result accumulation where individual
iteration times are recorded in nanoseconds, allowing flexible conversion to
other time units and statistical analysis.

Features:
    - Record individual iteration times in nanoseconds
    - Compute mean execution time using Welford's algorithm (numerically stable)
    - Compute standard deviation with sample variance (N-1)
    - Track min/max times across iterations
    - Support for up to 2^63-1 iterations
    - Efficient memory usage via Welford's online algorithm

Example:
   ```mojo
    var result = BenchmarkResult("relu_forward", iterations=1000)

    # Record individual iteration times
    for _ in range(1000):
        var start = now()
        relu(tensor)
        var end = now()
        result.record(end - start).

    # Query statistics
    var mean_ns = result.mean()  # Mean in nanoseconds as Float64
    var mean_us = result.mean() / 1000.0  # Convert to microseconds
    var std_ns = result.std()  # Standard deviation
    var min_ns = result.min_time()  # Minimum time
    var max_ns = result.max_time()  # Maximum time
    print(result)  # Formatted summary
    ```
