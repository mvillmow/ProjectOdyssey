# Delegation Rules - Quick Reference

## Core Delegation Rules

### Rule 1: Scope Reduction

Each delegation reduces scope by one level:

```text
System → Section → Module → Component → Function → Line
```

### Rule 2: Specification Detail

Each level adds more detail:

```text
Strategic goals → Tactical plans → Component specs → Implementation details → Code
```

### Rule 3: Autonomy Increase

Lower levels have more implementation freedom, less strategic freedom

### Rule 4: Review Responsibility

Each level reviews the work of the level below

### Rule 5: Escalation Path

Issues escalate one level up until resolved

### Rule 6: Horizontal Coordination

Same-level agents coordinate when sharing resources or dependencies

## When to Delegate

### Delegate Down When

- ✅ Task is too detailed for current level
- ✅ Specific expertise required
- ✅ Work can be parallelized
- ✅ Clear specification can be provided

### Escalate Up When

- ⬆️ Decision exceeds your authority
- ⬆️ Resources needed from higher level
- ⬆️ Blocker cannot be resolved at current level
- ⬆️ Conflicts with other same-level agents

### Coordinate Horizontally When

- ↔️ Sharing files or resources
- ↔️ Dependencies between components
- ↔️ Interface negotiation needed
- ↔️ Cross-cutting concerns (security, performance)

## Delegation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Delegation

```text
Agent A
  ↓ completes work
  ↓ delegates to B
Agent B
  ↓ completes work
  ↓ delegates to C
Agent C
```

**Use When**: Tasks have strict dependencies

### Pattern 2: Parallel Delegation

```text
Orchestrator
  ├─> Agent A (parallel)
  ├─> Agent B (parallel)
  └─> Agent C (parallel)
```

**Use When**: Tasks are independent

### Pattern 3: Fan-Out/Fan-In

```text
Orchestrator
  ├─> Agent A ─┐
  ├─> Agent B ─┼─> Integration Agent
  └─> Agent C ─┘
```

**Use When**: Parallel work needs final integration

## Skip-Level Delegation

**General Rule**: Follow the hierarchy (don't skip levels). However, for truly trivial tasks, skip-level delegation is acceptable.

### When Skip-Level Is Acceptable

**Simple Bug Fixes** (< 20 lines, well-defined, no design decisions):

- Typos or obvious errors
- Missing imports
- Formatting issues
- Clear, localized fixes

**Process**: Higher-level agent can delegate directly to implementation level when:

1. No design decisions needed
2. No architectural impact
3. Fix is obvious and unambiguous
4. < 20 lines of code changes

### When Skip-Level Is NOT Acceptable

**Never skip levels for**:

- New features (any size)
- Refactoring (any scope)
- Performance optimization
- Security fixes
- API changes
- Anything requiring judgment or design

**Rule of Thumb**: If it requires thinking beyond "fix the typo", use the full hierarchy.

### Documentation Location

All work, even trivial fixes, must document outputs in `/notes/issues/<issue-number>/README.md`. Always verify
the GitHub issue exists before starting work.

## Mojo-Specific Delegation

### Language Choice Decisions

**Level 0-1 Decides**:

- Which components use Mojo vs Python
- Overall language strategy
- Interop patterns

**Level 2-3 Implements**:

- Designs Mojo-specific interfaces
- Plans performance-critical paths
- Structures Mojo modules

**Level 4-5 Executes**:

- Writes Mojo code
- Implements Mojo patterns
- Uses Mojo standard library

### Performance-Critical Paths

**Level 2** (Module Design):

- Identifies performance bottlenecks
- Decides where to use Mojo
- Designs SIMD opportunities

**Level 3** (Component Specialist):

- Specifies SIMD operations
- Plans memory layout
- Designs for vectorization

**Level 4** (Engineer):

- Implements SIMD code
- Optimizes memory access
- Uses `@parameter` decorators

## Status Reporting

### Report Frequency

- **Daily**: For active implementation
- **Weekly**: For planning phases
- **On Completion**: Always
- **On Blocker**: Immediately

### Report Template

```markdown
## Status Report

**Agent**: [Your Name]
**Level**: [0-5]
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Phase**: [Plan/Test/Impl/Package/Cleanup]

### Progress: [%]

### Completed

- [Item 1]

### In Progress

- [Item 1]

### Blockers

- [None / Description]

### Next Steps

- [Step 1]

```

## Handoff Protocol

### When Completing Work

1. **Document What Was Done**
2. **List Artifacts Produced** (files, configs, docs)
3. **Specify Next Steps** for receiving agent
4. **Note Any Gotchas** or important context
5. **Request Confirmation** from receiving agent

### Handoff Template

```markdown
## Task Handoff

**From**: [Your Agent Name]
**To**: [Next Agent Name]
**Task**: [Description]

**Completed**:

- [What you did]

**Artifacts**:

- `path/to/file.mojo` - [description]

**Next Steps**:

- [What next agent should do]

**Notes**:

- [Important context]

```

## Escalation Protocol

### Blocker Escalation

```text
1. Identify blocker
2. Document:
   - What's blocking you
   - What you've tried
   - Impact on timeline
3. Escalate to immediate superior
4. Superior resolves or escalates further

```

### Conflict Escalation

```text
1. Agents attempt to resolve
2. If unresolved, both escalate to common superior
3. Superior reviews, decides, provides rationale
4. Both agents implement decision

```

## Decision Authority

| Level | Can Decide | Must Escalate |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| 0 | System architecture, tech stack, paper selection | Business strategy |
| 1 | Section organization, cross-module deps | System-wide changes |
| 2 | Module interfaces, component design | Cross-section impacts |
| 3 | Component implementation approach | Module-wide refactoring |
| 4 | Function implementation, algorithm choice | Component restructuring |
| 5 | Variable names, code formatting | Function-level decisions |

## Git Worktree Coordination

### Worktree Assignment

- **One worktree per issue**
- **One agent (or team) per worktree**
- **Clear ownership documented**

### Cross-Worktree Communication

**Option 1**: Cherry-pick commits

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

**Option 2**: Temporary merge

```bash
git merge --no-commit <branch>
```

**Option 3**: Coordinate via specs

- Document in specifications (local plan.md or tracked notes/issues/)
- Implement independently
- Merge during packaging phase

## Mojo Code Coordination

### When Writing Mojo

**Coordinate on**:

- Struct definitions (shared types)
- Trait implementations (interfaces)
- Memory management patterns
- SIMD vector widths

**Document in specifications**:

- Type signatures
- Performance requirements
- Memory constraints
- Parallelization strategy

**Note**: Use local plan.md files (not tracked in git) for task-relative planning, or tracked documentation in
`notes/issues/` for team-wide specifications.

### Mojo Style Consistency

**Level 2-3 Establishes**:

- Naming conventions
- File organization
- Import patterns
- Documentation style

**Level 4-5 Follows**:

- Applies style guide
- Uses consistent patterns
- Maintains conventions

## Quick Decision Tree

```text
Can I decide this myself?
  ├─ YES → Decide, document, proceed
  └─ NO → Can my superior decide?
         ├─ YES → Escalate one level
         └─ NO → Escalate higher

Do I need input from peers?
  ├─ YES → Coordinate horizontally first
  └─ NO → Proceed independently

Is this blocked?
  ├─ YES → Can I resolve?
  │       ├─ YES → Resolve and document
  │       └─ NO → Escalate
  └─ NO → Proceed

Should I delegate this?
  ├─ Too detailed for my level? → Delegate down
  ├─ Requires specific expertise? → Delegate to specialist
  ├─ Can run in parallel? → Delegate to multiple agents
  └─ Within my scope? → Handle myself
```

## Anti-Patterns

### Don't Do This

**Skipping Levels**:

- ❌ Junior Engineer → Chief Architect
- ✅ Junior Engineer → Implementation Engineer → Component Specialist → ...

**Micro-Managing**:

- ❌ Orchestrator specifying variable names
- ✅ Orchestrator specifying requirements

**Working in Silos**:

- ❌ No communication, surprise conflicts
- ✅ Regular status updates, coordinate interfaces

**Hoarding Decisions**:

- ❌ Make all decisions yourself
- ✅ Delegate appropriately, trust hierarchy
