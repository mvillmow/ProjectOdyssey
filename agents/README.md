# Agent System Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains documentation, templates, and reference materials for the ml-odyssey multi-level agent
hierarchy. The actual operational agent configurations are in `.claude/agents/` following Claude Code conventions.

## Directory Purpose

### This Directory (`agents/`)

- **Purpose**: Team documentation and reference materials
- **Contents**: READMEs, diagrams, templates, examples
- **Usage**: Read by humans to understand and create agents
- **Version Control**: Committed to repository for team sharing

### Operational Directory (`.claude/agents/`)

- **Purpose**: Working sub-agent configuration files
- **Contents**: Agent .md files that Claude Code executes
- **Usage**: Read by Claude Code to invoke agents
- **Version Control**: Committed to repository for consistency

## Quick Start

### Understanding the System

1. **Read the Hierarchy**: Start with [hierarchy.md](hierarchy.md) to understand the 6 levels
1. **Learn Delegation**: Read [delegation-rules.md](delegation-rules.md) for coordination patterns
1. **Review Templates**: Check [templates/](templates/) for agent configuration examples

### Creating a New Agent

1. **Identify the Level**: Determine which level (0-5) this agent belongs to
1. **Choose a Template**: Use the appropriate template from `templates/`
1. **Fill in Details**: Customize for your specific agent's role
1. **Add to `.claude/agents/`**: Place the config file in `.claude/agents/`
1. **Test**: Verify Claude Code can load and invoke the agent

### Using Agents

Agents can be invoked in two ways:

**Automatic Invocation** (Recommended):

```text
User: "Design the architecture for the authentication module"
→ Claude recognizes task matches Architecture Design Agent
→ Agent invokes automatically
```text

### Explicit Invocation

```text
User: "Use the architecture design agent to plan the auth module"
→ Claude explicitly invokes Architecture Design Agent
```text

## Agent Hierarchy (6 Levels)

### Level 0: Meta-Orchestrator

- **Chief Architect Agent**: System-wide decisions, paper selection, strategic planning

### Level 1: Section Orchestrators

- Foundation, Shared Library, Tooling, Paper, CI/CD, Agentic Workflows Orchestrators
- Manage major repository sections

### Level 2: Module Design Agents & Orchestrators

### Design Agents

- Architecture, Integration, Security Design Agents
- Design module structure and interfaces

### Review Orchestrators

- Code Review Orchestrator
- Coordinates 13 specialized review agents

### Level 3: Component Specialists & Review Specialists

**Implementation/Execution Specialists** (11 agents):

- Implementation, Test, Documentation, Performance, Security Specialists
- Blog Writer, Numerical Stability, Test Flakiness, PR Cleanup Specialists
- Mojo Syntax Validator, CI Failure Analyzer
- Handle specific component aspects and execution planning

**Code Review Specialists** (13 agents):

- Implementation, Documentation, Test Review Specialists
- Security, Safety Review Specialists
- Mojo Language, Performance Review Specialists
- Algorithm, Architecture Review Specialists
- Data Engineering, Paper, Research Review Specialists
- Dependency Review Specialist

### Level 4: Implementation Engineers

- Senior, Standard, Test, Documentation, Performance Engineers
- Write code, tests, documentation

### Level 5: Junior Engineers

- Handle simple tasks, boilerplate, formatting

**See [hierarchy.md](hierarchy.md) for complete details**

## Skills System

Skills are reusable capabilities separate from agents. They're in `.claude/skills/`.

### Key Distinction

- **Agents** = Decision-makers with separate contexts
- **Skills** = Reusable capabilities invoked within agent context

### Skills Taxonomy

- **Tier 1**: Foundational (used by all agents) - code analysis, generation, testing
- **Tier 2**: Domain-specific (specific agent types) - paper analysis, ML ops, documentation
- **Tier 3**: Specialized (narrow use cases) - security scanning, performance profiling

**See [/notes/review/skills-design.md](../notes/review/skills-design.md) for complete skills documentation**

## Delegation Patterns

### Decomposition Delegation

Higher levels break tasks into smaller pieces and delegate down:

```text
Chief Architect → Section Orchestrator → Module Agent → Component Specialist → Engineer
```text

### Specialization Delegation

Orchestrators delegate to specialists based on expertise:

```text
Section Orchestrator
  ├─> Architecture Design (for architecture)
  ├─> Security Design (for security)
  └─> Integration Design (for integration)
```text

### Parallel Delegation

Independent tasks run simultaneously:

```text
Component Specialist
  ├─> Test Engineer (parallel)
  ├─> Implementation Engineer (parallel)
  └─> Documentation Writer (parallel)
```text

**See [delegation-rules.md](delegation-rules.md) for complete patterns**

## Workflow Integration

### 5-Phase Workflow

**Phase 1: Plan** (Sequential)

- Levels 0-2: Orchestrators and designers create specifications

**Phases 2-4: Test/Implementation/Package** (Parallel)

- Levels 3-5: Specialists and engineers execute in parallel
- **Package Phase**: Create distributable artifacts (.mojopkg files, archives, CI/CD workflows)
  - NOT just documenting existing structures
  - Must produce actual installable packages

**Phase 5: Cleanup** (Sequential)

- All levels: Review and refactor

### Git Worktree Strategy

Each GitHub issue gets its own worktree:

- `worktrees/issue-62-plan-agents/` - Plan phase
- `worktrees/issue-63-test-agents/` - Test phase (parallel)
- `worktrees/issue-64-impl-agents/` - Implementation (parallel)
- `worktrees/issue-65-pkg-agents/` - Packaging (parallel)
- `worktrees/issue-66-cleanup-agents/` - Cleanup (sequential)

**See [/notes/review/worktree-strategy.md](../notes/review/worktree-strategy.md) for complete workflow**

## Code Review System

### Overview

A comprehensive code review system with 14 agents (1 orchestrator + 13 specialists) ensures thorough review across all dimensions:

**Code Review Orchestrator** (Level 2):

- Analyzes PRs and routes to appropriate specialists
- Prevents overlap through dimension-based routing
- Consolidates feedback from multiple specialists
- Integrates with CI/CD pipeline

**Review Specialists** (Level 3):

- Implementation: Code correctness, logic, maintainability
- Documentation: Markdown, comments, docstrings, API docs
- Test: Test coverage, quality, assertions
- Security: Vulnerabilities, OWASP top 10, input validation
- Safety: Memory safety, type safety, undefined behavior
- Mojo Language: Ownership, SIMD, fn vs def, traits
- Performance: Algorithmic complexity, cache efficiency
- Algorithm: ML algorithm correctness, numerical stability
- Architecture: System design, modularity, patterns
- Data Engineering: Data pipelines, preprocessing
- Paper: Academic writing, citations
- Research: Experimental design, reproducibility
- Dependency: Version management, licenses

### No-Overlap Strategy

Each specialist reviews one dimension exclusively:

| Dimension | Specialist | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Logic Correctness | Implementation | Bug detection, control flow |
| Memory Safety | Safety | Leaks, use-after-free |
| Security Exploits | Security | SQL injection, XSS |
| Language Idioms | Mojo Language | Ownership patterns, SIMD |
| Performance | Performance | Big O complexity |
| ML Correctness | Algorithm | Gradient computation |
| System Design | Architecture | Module structure |
| Test Quality | Test | Coverage, assertions |

### Review Workflow

## Best Practices

### Creating Agents

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each agent has one clear role
1. **Clear Description**: Description should trigger appropriate auto-invocation
1. **Tool Minimalism**: Only request tools actually needed
1. **Rich Examples**: Show realistic usage scenarios
1. **Clear Constraints**: Document what agent should NOT do

### Using Agents

1. **Trust the Hierarchy**: Let orchestrators delegate, don't micromanage
1. **Communicate Status**: Report progress clearly
1. **Escalate Blockers**: Don't stay stuck, escalate when needed
1. **Coordinate Horizontally**: Communicate with peer agents
1. **Document Decisions**: Capture rationale for future reference

### Maintenance

1. **Update Templates**: Keep templates current with best practices
1. **Share Learnings**: Document what works and what doesn't
1. **Iterate Configs**: Improve agent configs based on usage
1. **Version Control**: Commit all changes to agent configs
1. **Team Review**: Review new agents with team

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Implementing a New Feature

1. **Chief Architect** analyzes requirements
1. **Section Orchestrator** breaks into modules
1. **Architecture Design Agent** designs module structure
1. **Component Specialists** plan Test/Impl/Package in parallel
1. **Engineers** execute in parallel worktrees
1. **All Levels** participate in cleanup

### Pattern: Fixing a Bug

1. **Test Engineer** writes failing test
1. **Component Specialist** analyzes root cause
1. **Implementation Engineer** fixes code
1. **Test Engineer** verifies fix
1. **Documentation Writer** updates docs if needed

### Pattern: Refactoring

1. **Component Specialist** identifies refactoring need
1. **Architecture Design Agent** reviews impact
1. **Implementation Engineer** performs refactoring
1. **Test Engineer** ensures tests still pass
1. **Performance Engineer** verifies no performance regression

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Invoked Automatically

**Problem**: Claude doesn't automatically invoke your agent

### Solutions

1. Check description - make it specific and clear
1. Add trigger keywords user would naturally say
1. Test with explicit invocation first
1. Review Claude Code sub-agents documentation

### Agent Scope Unclear

**Problem**: Unclear which level agent belongs to

### Solutions

1. Review [hierarchy.md](hierarchy.md) for level definitions
1. Consider decision scope: System → Section → Module → Component → Function → Line
1. Ask: What does this agent decide vs execute?

### Coordination Issues

**Problem**: Agents aren't coordinating effectively

### Solutions

1. Review [delegation-rules.md](delegation-rules.md)
1. Use git worktrees for isolation
1. Establish clear handoff protocols
1. Document interfaces explicitly
