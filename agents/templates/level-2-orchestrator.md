  - [Coordination trigger 2]

### Coordinates With

- [[Peer Orchestrator A](./peer-a.md)] - [Coordination scenario]
- [[Peer Orchestrator B](./peer-b.md)] - [Coordination scenario]

### Example Scenarios

<!-- Provide 2-4 realistic scenarios showing routing decisions -->
<!-- Each scenario should demonstrate: -->
<!--   1. Input/trigger -->
<!--   2. Analysis process -->

<!--   4. What gets routed to each specialist -->
<!--   5. What does NOT get routed (and why) -->

#### Example 1: [Scenario Title - Primary Use Case]

**Input**:

```text
[Describe the incoming work item]
[List relevant files/changes/context]
```

**Analysis**:

- [What you observe about this work]
- [Key characteristics that drive routing]
- [Impact assessment]

**Routing**:

```text
✅ [Specialist A] → [What they handle and why]
✅ [Specialist B] → [What they handle and why]
✅ [Specialist C] → [What they handle and why]

❌ NOT [Specialist X] ([reason for exclusion])
❌ NOT [Specialist Y] ([reason for exclusion])
❌ NOT [Specialist Z] ([reason for exclusion])
```

**Consolidation**:

- [How you combine specialist outputs]
- [How you handle conflicts]
- [Final deliverable]

#### Example 2: [Scenario Title - Edge Case or Complex Scenario]

**Input**:

```text
[Describe a more complex scenario]
[Show overlap potential or conflict]
```

**Analysis**:

- [Multi-dimensional analysis]
- [Competing concerns]
- [Trade-offs to consider]

**Routing**:

```text
✅ [Specialist A] → [Specific dimension they cover]
✅ [Specialist B] → [Different dimension, no overlap]
✅ [Specialist C] → [Yet another dimension]
✅ [Specialist D] → [Cross-cutting concern with clear scope]

❌ NOT [Specialist X] ([why not needed])
```

**Special Handling**:

- [Any special coordination needed]
- [Conflict resolution approach]
- [Escalation if needed]

#### Example 3: [Scenario Title - Minimal Involvement Case]

**Input**:

```text
[Simple, focused work item]
```

**Analysis**:

- [Why this is straightforward]
- [Limited scope assessment]

**Routing**:

```text
✅ [Specialist A] → [Primary handler]
✅ [Specialist B] → [Only if this specific condition]

❌ NOT [Specialist C-Z] ([why extensive coordination not needed])
```

### Overlap Prevention Strategy

#### Dimension-Based Routing

Each aspect of [work] is [handled/reviewed] along independent dimensions:

| Dimension | Specialist | What They [Handle/Review] |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------------|
| **[Dimension 1]** | [Specialist Name] | [Specific scope and boundaries] |
| **[Dimension 2]** | [Specialist Name] | [Specific scope and boundaries] |
| **[Dimension 3]** | [Specialist Name] | [Specific scope and boundaries] |
| **[Dimension 4]** | [Specialist Name] | [Specific scope and boundaries] |
| **[Dimension 5]** | [Specialist Name] | [Specific scope and boundaries] |

<!-- Add 5-12 dimensions -->

**Rule**: Each [work item/file/aspect] is routed to exactly one specialist per dimension.

#### Conflict Resolution

When specialists disagree:

1. **[Conflict Type A]**: [How to resolve - priority rule or escalation]
2. **[Conflict Type B]**: [Resolution approach]
3. **[Conflict Type C]**: [When to escalate vs resolve]
4. **[Conflict Type D]**: [Default behavior or guiding principle]

Escalate to [Higher Authority] if [escalation criteria].

## Customization Instructions

### Step 1: Define Your Domain

Answer these questions to customize this template:

1. **What does this orchestrator coordinate?** (e.g., code reviews, testing, deployments)
2. **How many specialists does it coordinate?** (typically 5-15 for Level 2)
3. **What are the main categorization dimensions?** (e.g., file type, domain area, complexity)
4. **What triggers this orchestrator?** (e.g., PR creation, issue assignment, schedule)
5. **What does it produce?** (e.g., consolidated report, deployment plan, test strategy)

### Step 2: Identify Your Specialists

List all specialists this orchestrator coordinates:

| Specialist Name | Primary Responsibility | When to Route |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------|
| [Name] | [Responsibility] | [Trigger condition] |
| [Name] | [Responsibility] | [Trigger condition] |
| ... | ... | ... |

Group specialists into 3-5 logical categories.

### Step 3: Define Routing Rules

Create routing tables for:

1. **Primary dimension** (e.g., file extension, task type, domain)
2. **Secondary dimension** (e.g., change type, complexity, impact)
3. **Tertiary dimension** (e.g., risk level, priority, dependencies)

Ensure rules prevent overlap by assigning clear, non-overlapping scopes.

### Step 4: Write Example Scenarios

For each scenario, show:

1. **Input**: What triggers the orchestrator
2. **Analysis**: How you assess the situation
3. **Routing**: Which specialists get involved (and which don't)
4. **Rationale**: Why each routing decision was made
5. **Consolidation**: How specialist outputs combine

Include:

- **Primary scenario**: Most common case
- **Complex scenario**: Multiple specialists, potential conflicts
- **Simple scenario**: Minimal coordination needed

### Step 5: Define Success Criteria

What does "done" look like for this orchestrator?

- [ ] Measurable completion criteria
- [ ] Quality gates
- [ ] Deliverable checklist
- [ ] Handoff requirements

### Step 6: Test Your Configuration

```bash
# 1. Save customized config to .claude/agents/
cp agents/templates/level-2-orchestrator.md .claude/agents/[your-orchestrator].md

# 2. Replace all placeholders with actual values
# 3. Remove template instructions and comments
# 4. Test invocation in Claude Code

# 5. Verify behavior:
# - Orchestrator analyzes work correctly
# - Routing decisions are logical and non-overlapping
# - Specialists receive clear, scoped assignments
# - Consolidation produces useful output
```

## Example: How Code Review Orchestrator Uses This Template

**Answers to Step 1 questions**:

1. **What does it coordinate?** Code reviews across 13 specialist dimensions
2. **How many specialists?** 13 review specialists
3. **Main dimensions?** File extension, change type, impact level
4. **Trigger?** PR creation or cleanup phase
5. **Produces?** Consolidated review report with severity-categorized findings

**Routing dimensions**:

- **Primary**: File extension (.mojo → Mojo Language Specialist, .md → Documentation Specialist)
- **Secondary**: Change type (ML algorithm → Algorithm Specialist, security → Security Specialist)
- **Tertiary**: Impact (critical path → Performance + Safety, breaking changes → Architecture)

**Specialists** (13 total, grouped into 5 categories):

- Core (3): Implementation, Test, Documentation
- Security & Safety (2): Security, Safety
- Language & Performance (2): Mojo Language, Performance
- Domain (3): Algorithm, Data Engineering, Architecture
- Research (3): Paper, Research, Dependency

**Key innovation**: Dimension-based routing prevents overlap by assigning each specialist a unique dimension (correctness, security, performance, etc.)
