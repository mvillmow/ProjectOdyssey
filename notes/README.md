## 5-Phase Development Process

Each component follows a 5-phase workflow:

1. **Plan** → Design and document the approach
2. **Test** → Write tests following TDD
3. **Implementation** → Build the functionality
4. **Packaging** → Integrate with existing code
5. **Cleanup** → Refactor and finalize

Each phase has its own GitHub issue with detailed instructions.

## Support
