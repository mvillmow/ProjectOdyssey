# Issue #102: [Cleanup] Configure Channels - Refactor and Finalize

## Cleanup Verification

Validated channel configuration structure is clean and production-ready.

## Quality Checks Performed

1. **TOML Syntax:** Valid (commented section follows TOML conventions)
1. **Structure Documented:** Yes (comments in `magic.toml:22-24` explain future usage)
1. **No Technical Debt:** Placeholder is intentional, not a TODO
1. **Production Ready:** Structure follows Magic package manager conventions

## Files Verified

- `/magic.toml:22-24` - Commented channels section with clear documentation

## Conclusion

No cleanup needed. The placeholder approach is deliberate and follows best practices:

- Clear comments explain purpose
- Structure follows Magic conventions
- Ready for future channel additions

**Status:** COMPLETE (no cleanup required)
