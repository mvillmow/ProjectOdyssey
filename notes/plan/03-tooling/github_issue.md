# GitHub Issues

**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Tooling - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Build comprehensive developer tooling to streamline paper implementation, testing, and validation workflows. This includes scaffolding tools for creating new paper implementations, test runners for automated testing, setup scripts for environment configuration, and validation tools to ensure code quality and completeness.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Foundation directory structure and configuration
- Understanding of paper implementation workflow
- Testing and validation requirements
- Environment setup needs

## Expected Outputs
- Paper scaffolding CLI tool for generating new implementations
- Testing infrastructure with runners and coverage tools
- Setup scripts for Mojo installation and environment configuration
- Validation tools for code quality and completeness checks

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Paper scaffolding tool can generate complete paper structure
- [ ] Testing tools can discover, run, and report on all tests
- [ ] Setup scripts successfully configure development environment
- [ ] Validation tools catch common issues and enforce standards
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Additional Notes
Focus on creating simple, practical tools that solve real workflow problems. Avoid over-engineering - these tools should be easy to use and maintain. Prioritize developer experience and clear error messages.
