# GitHub Issues

**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Validation - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Build validation tools to ensure code quality, completeness, and correctness across the repository. These tools check paper implementations for proper structure, validate benchmarks against baselines, and verify overall project completeness.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Paper implementations
- Benchmark results and baselines
- Project requirements and standards
- Code quality rules

## Expected Outputs
- Paper validation reports
- Benchmark comparison results
- Completeness check reports
- Overall quality metrics
- Issues and recommendations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Papers are validated for structure and quality
- [ ] Benchmarks detect performance regressions
- [ ] Completeness checks catch missing items
- [ ] Reports are actionable and clear
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Additional Notes
Focus on catching common mistakes early. Make validation fast enough to run frequently. Provide specific, actionable feedback. Support both CLI and CI/CD usage.
