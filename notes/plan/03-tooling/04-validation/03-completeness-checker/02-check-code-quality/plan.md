# Check Code Quality

## Overview
Assess code quality across the repository using linting, style checking, and static analysis. This helps maintain consistent, high-quality code throughout the project.

## Parent Plan
[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans
None (Level 4 - implementation level)

## Inputs
- Source code files
- Quality rules and standards
- Linting configuration

## Outputs
- Code quality metrics
- Linting violations
- Style issues
- Quality score

## Steps
1. Run linters on Mojo and Python code
2. Check code style and formatting
3. Perform static analysis
4. Generate quality report

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All code files are analyzed
- [ ] Violations are clearly reported
- [ ] Quality metrics are meaningful
- [ ] Actionable fixes are suggested

## Notes
Use appropriate linters for each language. Check formatting consistency. Identify common issues: unused imports, dead code, complexity. Don't be overly strict - focus on meaningful issues. Allow configuration of rules.
