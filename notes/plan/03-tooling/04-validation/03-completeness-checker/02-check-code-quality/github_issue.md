# GitHub Issues

**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Check Code Quality - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Assess code quality across the repository using linting, style checking, and static analysis. This helps maintain consistent, high-quality code throughout the project.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Source code files
- Quality rules and standards
- Linting configuration

## Expected Outputs
- Code quality metrics
- Linting violations
- Style issues
- Quality score

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All code files are analyzed
- [ ] Violations are clearly reported
- [ ] Quality metrics are meaningful
- [ ] Actionable fixes are suggested

## Additional Notes
Use appropriate linters for each language. Check formatting consistency. Identify common issues: unused imports, dead code, complexity. Don't be overly strict - focus on meaningful issues. Allow configuration of rules.

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Check Code Quality - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Assess code quality across the repository using linting, style checking, and static analysis. This helps maintain consistent, high-quality code throughout the project.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:
