**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Completeness Checker - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Create a tool that verifies overall repository completeness by checking for required files, code quality, and generating comprehensive reports. This ensures the repository maintains high standards.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Repository structure
- Quality standards
- Required file list
- Code quality rules

## Expected Outputs
- Completeness report
- Missing files list
- Code quality metrics
- Overall health score
- Recommendations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All required files are checked
- [ ] Code quality is assessed
- [ ] Report is comprehensive and actionable
- [ ] Health score is meaningful
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Additional Notes
Check repository-wide concerns: all papers have tests, documentation is complete, no broken links. Assess code quality with linting and static analysis. Provide actionable recommendations for improvements.
