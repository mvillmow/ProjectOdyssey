# Completeness Checker

## Overview

Create a tool that verifies overall repository completeness by checking for required files, code quality, and generating comprehensive reports. This ensures the repository maintains high standards.

## Parent Plan

[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans

- [01-check-required-files/plan.md](01-check-required-files/plan.md)
- [02-check-code-quality/plan.md](02-check-code-quality/plan.md)
- [03-generate-report/plan.md](03-generate-report/plan.md)

## Inputs

- Repository structure
- Quality standards
- Required file list
- Code quality rules

## Outputs

- Completeness report
- Missing files list
- Code quality metrics
- Overall health score
- Recommendations

## Steps

1. Check all required files are present
2. Assess code quality across repository
3. Generate comprehensive report

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All required files are checked
- [ ] Code quality is assessed
- [ ] Report is comprehensive and actionable
- [ ] Health score is meaningful
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Notes

Check repository-wide concerns: all papers have tests, documentation is complete, no broken links. Assess code quality with linting and static analysis. Provide actionable recommendations for improvements.
