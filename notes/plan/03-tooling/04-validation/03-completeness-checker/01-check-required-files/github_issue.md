# GitHub Issues

**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Check Required Files - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Verify that all required repository files are present including configuration files, documentation, and standard project files. This ensures the repository is complete and properly configured.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Required files list
- Repository structure
- File location rules

## Expected Outputs
- File presence check results
- Missing files list
- Incorrect file locations
- Recommendations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All required files are checked
- [ ] Missing files are identified
- [ ] Misplaced files are detected
- [ ] Clear guidance for fixes

## Additional Notes
Check for: README.md, LICENSE, .gitignore, pyproject.toml/pixi.toml, CONTRIBUTING.md. Verify each paper has required files. Check shared code directories have proper structure. Flag empty or placeholder files.

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Check Required Files - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Verify that all required repository files are present including configuration files, documentation, and standard project files. This ensures the repository is complete and properly configured.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:

- Missing files list
- Incorrect file locations
- Recommendations

## Test Success Criteria
- [ ] All required files are checked
- [ ] Missing files are identified
- [ ] Misplaced files are detected
- [ ] Clear guidance for fixes

## Implementation Steps
1. Load list of required files
2. Check each file exists in expected location
3. Verify file is not empty
4. Report missing or misplaced files

## Notes
Check for: README.md, LICENSE, .gitignore, pyproject.toml/pixi.toml, CONTRIBUTING.md. Verify each paper has required files. Check shared code directories have proper structure. Flag empty or placeholder files.
