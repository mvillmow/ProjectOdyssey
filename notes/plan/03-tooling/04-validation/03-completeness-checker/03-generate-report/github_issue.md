**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Generate Report - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Generate comprehensive reports summarizing all validation results including completeness checks, code quality, and overall repository health. Reports provide actionable insights for improvement.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Required files check results
- Code quality metrics
- All validation data

## Expected Outputs
- Comprehensive HTML report
- Text summary for console
- JSON data for tooling
- Overall health score

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Reports include all validation data
- [ ] Health score is meaningful
- [ ] Multiple output formats supported
- [ ] Reports guide improvements

## Additional Notes
Create visual HTML reports with charts and graphs. Provide concise console summaries. Support JSON for CI/CD integration. Highlight most important issues first. Track health score over time to show progress.
