**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Check Tests - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Validate that paper has adequate test coverage with properly structured test files. This check ensures implementations are tested and quality is maintained.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Paper tests directory
- Test file patterns
- Coverage requirements

## Expected Outputs
- Test validation results
- Test file inventory
- Coverage assessment
- Missing test areas

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Test files are discovered
- [ ] Naming conventions are checked
- [ ] Test count is assessed
- [ ] Coverage gaps are identified

## Additional Notes
Check for test files in tests/ directory. Verify naming follows conventions (test_*.mojo, *_test.mojo). Don't require specific coverage percentage but flag papers with no tests. Encourage comprehensive testing.

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Check Tests - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Validate that paper has adequate test coverage with properly structured test files. This check ensures implementations are tested and quality is maintained.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:
- Test validation results
- Test file inventory
- Coverage assessment
- Missing test areas

## Test Success Criteria
- [ ] Test files are discovered
- [ ] Naming conventions are checked
- [ ] Test count is assessed
- [ ] Coverage gaps are identified

## Implementation Steps
1. Check tests directory exists and has files
2. Verify test files follow naming conventions
3. Count tests and assess coverage
4. Report on test adequacy

## Notes
Check for test files in tests/ directory. Verify naming follows conventions (test_*.mojo, *_test.mojo). Don't require specific coverage percentage but flag papers with no tests. Encourage comprehensive testing.
