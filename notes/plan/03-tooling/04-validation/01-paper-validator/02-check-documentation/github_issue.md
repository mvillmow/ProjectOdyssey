**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Check Documentation - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Validate that paper documentation is complete, well-formatted, and contains required information. This ensures papers are properly documented and understandable to others.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Paper README.md and documentation files
- Documentation requirements
- Content quality standards

## Expected Outputs
- Documentation validation results
- Missing sections identified
- Quality assessment
- Improvement suggestions

## Success Criteria
- [ ] README.md presence is checked
- [ ] Required sections are verified
- [ ] Formatting issues are detected
- [ ] Content quality is assessed

## Additional Notes
Check for required sections: Overview, Installation, Usage, Examples, References. Verify links work. Check for placeholder text. Assess clarity and completeness. Don't require perfect writing, just adequate documentation.
