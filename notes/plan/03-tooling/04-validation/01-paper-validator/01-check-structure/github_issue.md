# GitHub Issues

**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Check Structure - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Validate that paper directory structure follows repository conventions with all required directories and files present. This check ensures papers are organized consistently.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Paper directory path
- Structure requirements specification
- Repository conventions

## Expected Outputs
- Structure validation results
- List of missing directories/files
- Naming violations
- Recommendations for fixes

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All required directories are checked
- [ ] All required files are verified
- [ ] Naming conventions are validated
- [ ] Clear feedback on violations

## Additional Notes
Check for standard structure: src/ for implementation, tests/ for tests, docs/ for documentation, README.md in root. Flag unexpected directories or files. Suggest corrections for common mistakes.

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Check Structure - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Validate that paper directory structure follows repository conventions with all required directories and files present. This check ensures papers are organized consistently.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:
- Structure validation results
- List of missing directories/files
- Naming violations
- Recommendations for fixes

## Test Success Criteria
- [ ] All required directories are checked
- [ ] All required files are verified
- [ ] Naming conventions are validated
- [ ] Clear feedback on violations

## Implementation Steps
1. Check required directories exist (src, tests, docs)
2. Verify required files are present (README.md, etc.)
3. Validate naming conventions
4. Generate structure report

## Notes
Check for standard structure: src/ for implementation, tests/ for tests, docs/ for documentation, README.md in root. Flag unexpected directories or files. Suggest corrections for common mistakes.

## Integration Requirements
Based on outputs:
- Structure validation results
- List of missing directories/files
- Naming violations
- Recommendations for fixes

## Integration Steps
1. Check required directories exist (src, tests, docs)
2. Verify required files are present (README.md, etc.)
3. Validate naming conventions
4. Generate structure report

## Success Criteria
