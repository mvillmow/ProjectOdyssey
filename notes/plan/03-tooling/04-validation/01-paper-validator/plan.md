# Paper Validator

## Overview

Create a comprehensive validator for paper implementations that checks structure, documentation, and tests. The validator ensures papers follow repository standards and are complete before merging.

## Parent Plan

[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans

- [01-check-structure/plan.md](01-check-structure/plan.md)
- [02-check-documentation/plan.md](02-check-documentation/plan.md)
- [03-check-tests/plan.md](03-check-tests/plan.md)

## Inputs

- Paper directory
- Validation rules and standards
- Repository conventions

## Outputs

- Structure validation results
- Documentation quality assessment
- Test completeness report
- Overall validation score
- List of issues to fix

## Steps

1. Check paper directory structure
2. Validate documentation completeness and quality
3. Verify tests exist and are adequate

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All structural requirements are checked
- [ ] Documentation is validated
- [ ] Test coverage is assessed
- [ ] Clear actionable feedback provided
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Notes

Make validation strict but helpful. Provide examples of correct implementations. Allow configuration of validation rules per project. Support both interactive and CI/CD modes.
