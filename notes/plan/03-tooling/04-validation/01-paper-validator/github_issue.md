**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Paper Validator - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Create a comprehensive validator for paper implementations that checks structure, documentation, and tests. The validator ensures papers follow repository standards and are complete before merging.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Paper directory
- Validation rules and standards
- Repository conventions

## Expected Outputs
- Structure validation results
- Documentation quality assessment
- Test completeness report
- Overall validation score
- List of issues to fix

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All structural requirements are checked
- [ ] Documentation is validated
- [ ] Test coverage is assessed
- [ ] Clear actionable feedback provided
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Additional Notes
Make validation strict but helpful. Provide examples of correct implementations. Allow configuration of validation rules per project. Support both interactive and CI/CD modes.
