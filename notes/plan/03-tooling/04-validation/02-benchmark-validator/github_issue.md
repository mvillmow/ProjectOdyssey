**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Benchmark Validator - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Create a validator that compares benchmark results against baselines to detect performance regressions. This tool ensures implementations maintain or improve performance over time.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Current benchmark results
- Baseline benchmark data
- Regression thresholds
- Performance metrics

## Expected Outputs
- Comparison results
- Detected regressions
- Performance trends
- Validation report

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Baselines are loaded correctly
- [ ] Comparisons are accurate
- [ ] Regressions are detected reliably
- [ ] Reports are clear and actionable
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Additional Notes
Allow some variance in benchmarks (system noise). Focus on significant regressions. Support multiple metrics (time, memory, accuracy). Provide historical trend analysis. Make it easy to update baselines.
