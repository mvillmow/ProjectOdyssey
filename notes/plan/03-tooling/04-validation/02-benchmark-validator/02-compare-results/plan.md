# Compare Results

## Overview

Compare current benchmark results against baseline to identify performance changes. This comparison forms the basis for regression detection and performance tracking.

## Parent Plan

[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans

None (Level 4 - implementation level)

## Inputs

- Current benchmark results
- Baseline benchmark data
- Comparison metrics

## Outputs

- Per-metric comparison results
- Performance deltas (absolute and percentage)
- Statistical significance
- Comparison summary

## Steps

1. Align current and baseline metrics
2. Calculate performance deltas
3. Assess statistical significance
4. Generate comparison report

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All metrics are compared
- [ ] Deltas are calculated correctly
- [ ] Statistical significance is assessed
- [ ] Results are clearly formatted

## Notes

Support multiple metrics: execution time, memory usage, accuracy. Calculate both absolute and percentage changes. Handle missing metrics gracefully. Account for normal variance in benchmarks.
