**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Compare Results - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Compare current benchmark results against baseline to identify performance changes. This comparison forms the basis for regression detection and performance tracking.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Current benchmark results
- Baseline benchmark data
- Comparison metrics

## Expected Outputs
- Per-metric comparison results
- Performance deltas (absolute and percentage)
- Statistical significance
- Comparison summary

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All metrics are compared
- [ ] Deltas are calculated correctly
- [ ] Statistical significance is assessed
- [ ] Results are clearly formatted

## Additional Notes
Support multiple metrics: execution time, memory usage, accuracy. Calculate both absolute and percentage changes. Handle missing metrics gracefully. Account for normal variance in benchmarks.
