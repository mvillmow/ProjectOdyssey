**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Report Results - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Generate comprehensive test reports showing successes, failures, and statistics. Reports provide clear visibility into test results with detailed information about failures to help developers debug issues quickly.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Test execution results
- Test output and error messages
- Execution timing information

## Expected Outputs
- Formatted test report
- Summary statistics
- Detailed failure information
- Exit code for CI/CD integration

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Reports clearly show pass/fail status
- [ ] Failure details help identify issues
- [ ] Summary statistics are accurate
- [ ] Output works in CI/CD environments

## Additional Notes
Use colors for console output to highlight failures. Show most important information first. Include helpful context like file paths and line numbers. Support JSON output for tooling integration.

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Report Results - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Generate comprehensive test reports showing successes, failures, and statistics. Reports provide clear visibility into test results with detailed information about failures to help developers debug issues quickly.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:
- Formatted test report
- Summary statistics
- Detailed failure information
- Exit code for CI/CD integration

## Test Success Criteria
- [ ] Reports clearly show pass/fail status
- [ ] Failure details help identify issues
- [ ] Summary statistics are accurate
- [ ] Output works in CI/CD environments

## Implementation Steps
1. Aggregate test results from execution
2. Format summary with counts and percentages
3. Display detailed failure information
4. Generate report in multiple formats (console, file)

## Notes
Use colors for console output to highlight failures. Show most important information first. Include helpful context like file paths and line numbers. Support JSON output for tooling integration.
