**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Paper Test Script - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Create a specialized script for testing individual paper implementations. This tool validates paper structure, runs paper-specific tests, and verifies that the implementation meets repository standards.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Paper name or path
- Paper directory structure
- Test files for the paper

## Expected Outputs
- Structure validation results
- Paper test execution results
- Overall paper health report
- Recommendations for improvements

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Can test any paper by name or path
- [ ] Structure validation catches common issues
- [ ] All paper tests are executed
- [ ] Report shows clear pass/fail status
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Additional Notes
Make it easy to test a single paper during development. Provide quick feedback on what's missing or broken. Integrate with main test runner but also work standalone.
