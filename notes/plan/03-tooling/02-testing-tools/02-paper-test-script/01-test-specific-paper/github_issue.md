# GitHub Issues

**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Test Specific Paper - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Implement logic to identify and focus testing on a specific paper implementation. This includes parsing paper identifiers, locating paper directories, and setting up the test context for a single paper.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Paper name or path from user
- Repository structure
- Paper naming conventions

## Expected Outputs
- Resolved paper directory path
- Paper metadata
- Test scope configuration

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Papers can be identified by name or path
- [ ] Invalid paper names are caught and reported
- [ ] Paper metadata is loaded correctly
- [ ] Test context is properly configured

## Additional Notes
Support flexible paper identification - by full name, partial match, or directory path. Handle cases where paper doesn't exist with clear error messages. Cache paper metadata for performance.

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Test Specific Paper - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Implement logic to identify and focus testing on a specific paper implementation. This includes parsing paper identifiers, locating paper directories, and setting up the test context for a single paper.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:
- Resolved paper directory path
- Paper metadata
- Test scope configuration

## Test Success Criteria
- [ ] Papers can be identified by name or path
- [ ] Invalid paper names are caught and reported
- [ ] Paper metadata is loaded correctly
- [ ] Test context is properly configured

## Implementation Steps
1. Parse paper identifier from user input
2. Locate paper directory in repository
3. Load paper configuration and metadata
4. Set up test context for the paper

## Notes
Support flexible paper identification - by full name, partial match, or directory path. Handle cases where paper doesn't exist with clear error messages. Cache paper metadata for performance.
