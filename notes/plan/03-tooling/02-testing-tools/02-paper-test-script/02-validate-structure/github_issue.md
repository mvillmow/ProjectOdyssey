**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Validate Structure - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Validate that a paper's directory structure and files meet repository requirements. This check ensures all necessary directories and files exist and are properly organized before running tests.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Paper directory path
- Structure requirements and rules
- Required file checklist

## Expected Outputs
- Validation report with pass/fail status
- List of missing or incorrect items
- Suggestions for fixing issues

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All required directories are checked
- [ ] All required files are verified
- [ ] Naming violations are detected
- [ ] Clear report helps fix issues

## Additional Notes
Check for standard paper structure: src/, tests/, docs/, README.md. Verify test files follow naming conventions. Provide helpful messages about what's missing and where it should be.

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Validate Structure - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Validate that a paper's directory structure and files meet repository requirements. This check ensures all necessary directories and files exist and are properly organized before running tests.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:
- Validation report with pass/fail status
- List of missing or incorrect items
- Suggestions for fixing issues

## Test Success Criteria
- [ ] All required directories are checked
- [ ] All required files are verified
- [ ] Naming violations are detected
- [ ] Clear report helps fix issues

## Implementation Steps
1. Check required directories exist
2. Verify required files are present
3. Validate file naming conventions
4. Generate structure validation report

## Notes
Check for standard paper structure: src/, tests/, docs/, README.md. Verify test files follow naming conventions. Provide helpful messages about what's missing and where it should be.
