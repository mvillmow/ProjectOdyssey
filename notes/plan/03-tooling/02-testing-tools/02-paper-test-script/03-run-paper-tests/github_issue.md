**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Run Paper Tests - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Execute all tests for a specific paper implementation. This focused test run helps developers get quick feedback on a single paper without running the entire test suite.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Paper directory path
- Test files for the paper
- Test execution configuration

## Expected Outputs
- Paper test results
- Test output and error messages
- Execution time and statistics
- Pass/fail summary

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All paper tests are discovered
- [ ] Tests execute correctly
- [ ] Results are clearly reported
- [ ] Fast feedback for development

## Additional Notes
Run only tests in the paper's test directory. Support both unit tests and integration tests. Show progress during execution. Make it easy to iterate quickly during development.

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Run Paper Tests - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Execute all tests for a specific paper implementation. This focused test run helps developers get quick feedback on a single paper without running the entire test suite.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:
- Paper test results
- Test output and error messages
- Execution time and statistics
- Pass/fail summary

## Test Success Criteria
- [ ] All paper tests are discovered
- [ ] Tests execute correctly
- [ ] Results are clearly reported
- [ ] Fast feedback for development

## Implementation Steps
1. Discover all tests for the paper
2. Execute tests in appropriate order
3. Collect results and output
4. Generate paper test report

## Notes
Run only tests in the paper's test directory. Support both unit tests and integration tests. Show progress during execution. Make it easy to iterate quickly during development.
