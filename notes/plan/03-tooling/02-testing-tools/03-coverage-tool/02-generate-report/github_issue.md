# GitHub Issues

**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Generate Report - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Generate coverage reports in multiple formats that clearly show which code is tested and which is not. Reports help developers identify gaps in test coverage and prioritize testing efforts.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Coverage data files
- Source code files
- Report format preferences

## Expected Outputs
- HTML coverage report with highlighted code
- Text summary report
- Per-file coverage statistics
- Overall coverage percentage

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Reports accurately reflect coverage data
- [ ] HTML report is easy to navigate
- [ ] Uncovered lines are clearly marked
- [ ] Summary shows key statistics

## Additional Notes
Use color coding in reports - green for covered, red for uncovered. Sort files by coverage percentage to highlight problem areas. Include line numbers and code context in HTML reports.

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Generate Report - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Generate coverage reports in multiple formats that clearly show which code is tested and which is not. Reports help developers identify gaps in test coverage and prioritize testing efforts.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:
- HTML coverage report with highlighted code
- Text summary report
- Per-file coverage statistics
- Overall coverage percentage

## Test Success Criteria
- [ ] Reports accurately reflect coverage data
- [ ] HTML report is easy to navigate
- [ ] Uncovered lines are clearly marked
- [ ] Summary shows key statistics

## Implementation Steps
1. Load and parse coverage data
2. Calculate coverage percentages per file
3. Generate HTML report with source highlighting
4. Create text summary for console output

## Notes
Use color coding in reports - green for covered, red for uncovered. Sort files by coverage percentage to highlight problem areas. Include line numbers and code context in HTML reports.
