**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Coverage Tool - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Build a code coverage tool that measures test completeness and identifies untested code. The tool collects coverage data during test execution, generates reports, and checks against minimum thresholds.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Test execution data
- Source code files
- Coverage thresholds configuration

## Expected Outputs
- Coverage data per file and function
- HTML and text coverage reports
- Threshold validation results
- Uncovered code locations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Coverage is accurately measured
- [ ] Reports clearly show covered/uncovered code
- [ ] Thresholds can be configured and validated
- [ ] Tool integrates with test runner
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Additional Notes
Focus on line coverage initially - branch coverage can come later. Make reports easy to understand with clear visualization. Set reasonable default thresholds (80% is common).

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Coverage Tool - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Build a code coverage tool that measures test completeness and identifies untested code. The tool collects coverage data during test execution, generates reports, and checks against minimum thresholds.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:
- Coverage data per file and function
- HTML and text coverage reports
- Threshold validation results
- Uncovered code locations

## Test Success Criteria
- [ ] Coverage is accurately measured
- [ ] Reports clearly show covered/uncovered code
- [ ] Thresholds can be configured and validated
- [ ] Tool integrates with test runner
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Implementation Steps
1. Collect coverage data during test execution
2. Generate coverage reports in multiple formats
3. Validate coverage against configured thresholds

## Notes
Focus on line coverage initially - branch coverage can come later. Make reports easy to understand with clear visualization. Set reasonable default thresholds (80% is common).
