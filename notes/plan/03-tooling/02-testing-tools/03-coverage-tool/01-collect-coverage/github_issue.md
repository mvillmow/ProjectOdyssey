**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Collect Coverage - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Implement coverage data collection during test execution. This involves instrumenting code to track which lines are executed, collecting execution data, and storing it for analysis.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Source code files to instrument
- Test execution environment
- Coverage collection configuration

## Expected Outputs
- Coverage data files
- Line execution counts
- File coverage mapping
- Raw coverage statistics

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Coverage is collected during test runs
- [ ] All source files are tracked
- [ ] Data is stored in accessible format
- [ ] Minimal performance impact on tests

## Additional Notes
Use standard coverage tools when available (coverage.py for Python). Store data in standard formats for tool compatibility. Exclude test files and generated code from coverage measurement.
