# GitHub Issues

**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Testing Tools - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Build comprehensive testing infrastructure including test runners, paper-specific test scripts, and coverage measurement tools. These tools automate test discovery, execution, and reporting to ensure code quality and catch regressions early.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Test files across repository
- Paper implementations
- Coverage configuration and thresholds

## Expected Outputs
- Test runner for discovering and executing tests
- Paper-specific test scripts for focused testing
- Coverage reports and threshold validation
- Test result summaries and logs

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Test runner can discover and run all tests
- [ ] Paper test script validates and tests individual papers
- [ ] Coverage tool measures and reports test coverage
- [ ] All tools provide clear, actionable output
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Additional Notes
Focus on making testing easy and fast. Tests should be discoverable automatically and run with a single command. Clear output helps developers understand failures quickly.
