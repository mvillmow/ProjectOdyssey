# Tooling

## Overview

Build comprehensive developer tooling to streamline paper implementation, testing, and validation workflows. This includes scaffolding tools for creating new paper implementations, test runners for automated testing, setup scripts for environment configuration, and validation tools to ensure code quality and completeness.

## Parent Plan

None (top-level)

## Child Plans

- [01-paper-scaffolding/plan.md](01-paper-scaffolding/plan.md)
- [02-testing-tools/plan.md](02-testing-tools/plan.md)
- [03-setup-scripts/plan.md](03-setup-scripts/plan.md)
- [04-validation/plan.md](04-validation/plan.md)

## Inputs

- Foundation directory structure and configuration
- Understanding of paper implementation workflow
- Testing and validation requirements
- Environment setup needs

## Outputs

- Paper scaffolding CLI tool for generating new implementations
- Testing infrastructure with runners and coverage tools
- Setup scripts for Mojo installation and environment configuration
- Validation tools for code quality and completeness checks

## Steps

1. Create paper scaffolding tools to automate new paper setup
2. Build testing infrastructure for running and validating tests
3. Develop setup scripts for environment and dependency management
4. Implement validation tools for quality assurance

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Paper scaffolding tool can generate complete paper structure
- [ ] Testing tools can discover, run, and report on all tests
- [ ] Setup scripts successfully configure development environment
- [ ] Validation tools catch common issues and enforce standards
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Notes

Focus on creating simple, practical tools that solve real workflow problems. Avoid over-engineering - these tools should be easy to use and maintain. Prioritize developer experience and clear error messages.
