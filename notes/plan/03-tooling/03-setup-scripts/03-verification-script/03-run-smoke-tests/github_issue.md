**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Run Smoke Tests - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Execute a minimal set of smoke tests to verify the environment works end-to-end. These quick tests catch major configuration issues and confirm the setup is functional.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Smoke test suite
- Test execution environment
- Expected test results

## Expected Outputs
- Smoke test results
- Any failures or errors
- Execution time
- Environment health assessment

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Smoke tests run successfully
- [ ] Tests complete quickly (seconds)
- [ ] Failures indicate specific issues
- [ ] Results confirm environment works

## Additional Notes
Keep smoke tests minimal - just verify basic functionality. Test Mojo compilation, Python imports, and critical paths. Run tests in isolation. Total execution should be under 10 seconds.

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Run Smoke Tests - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Execute a minimal set of smoke tests to verify the environment works end-to-end. These quick tests catch major configuration issues and confirm the setup is functional.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:
- Smoke test results
- Any failures or errors
- Execution time
- Environment health assessment

## Test Success Criteria
- [ ] Smoke tests run successfully
- [ ] Tests complete quickly (seconds)
- [ ] Failures indicate specific issues
- [ ] Results confirm environment works

## Implementation Steps
1. Identify smoke tests to run
2. Execute tests in clean environment
3. Collect results and output
4. Report on environment health

## Notes
Keep smoke tests minimal - just verify basic functionality. Test Mojo compilation, Python imports, and critical paths. Run tests in isolation. Total execution should be under 10 seconds.
