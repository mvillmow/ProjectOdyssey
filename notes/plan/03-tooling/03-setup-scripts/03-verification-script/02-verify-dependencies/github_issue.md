**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Verify Dependencies - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Check that all required project dependencies are installed and meet version requirements. This ensures the development environment has everything needed for the project.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Dependency specifications
- Required version constraints
- Python environment

## Expected Outputs
- Dependency status report
- List of missing dependencies
- Version mismatches
- Installation recommendations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All dependencies are checked
- [ ] Version compatibility is validated
- [ ] Missing dependencies are identified
- [ ] Clear installation guidance provided

## Additional Notes
Check both Python packages and system libraries. Support checking pixi environment. Suggest commands to install missing dependencies. Handle optional dependencies gracefully.

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Verify Dependencies - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Check that all required project dependencies are installed and meet version requirements. This ensures the development environment has everything needed for the project.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:
- Dependency status report
- List of missing dependencies
- Version mismatches
- Installation recommendations

## Test Success Criteria
- [ ] All dependencies are checked
- [ ] Version compatibility is validated
- [ ] Missing dependencies are identified
- [ ] Clear installation guidance provided

## Implementation Steps
1. Load dependency requirements from project files
2. Check each dependency is installed
3. Verify versions meet requirements
4. Report missing or incompatible dependencies

## Notes
Check both Python packages and system libraries. Support checking pixi environment. Suggest commands to install missing dependencies. Handle optional dependencies gracefully.
