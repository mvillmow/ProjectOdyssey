**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Verification Script - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Create a verification script that checks the development environment is properly configured. This script validates Mojo installation, dependencies, and runs smoke tests to confirm everything works correctly.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Expected installation state
- Required dependencies list
- Smoke test suite

## Expected Outputs
- Verification report with pass/fail status
- List of any issues found
- Recommendations for fixing problems
- Overall environment health score

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All verification checks are performed
- [ ] Issues are clearly reported
- [ ] Helpful recommendations are provided
- [ ] Script exits with appropriate code
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Additional Notes
Make verification fast - should complete in seconds. Provide actionable error messages. Support verbose mode for detailed output. Allow running individual verification steps.
