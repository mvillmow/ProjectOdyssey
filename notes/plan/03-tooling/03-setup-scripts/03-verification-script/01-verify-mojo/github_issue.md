**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Verify Mojo - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Check that Mojo is properly installed, accessible from PATH, and the correct version. This verification ensures developers can compile and run Mojo code.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Expected Mojo version (optional)
- PATH environment variable
- Installation paths to check

## Expected Outputs
- Mojo installation status
- Installed version information
- PATH configuration status
- Any issues found

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Detects if Mojo is installed
- [ ] Reports correct version information
- [ ] Identifies PATH issues
- [ ] Provides helpful error messages

## Additional Notes
Check both system and user installations. Suggest installation steps if Mojo not found. Warn if version is too old or too new. Verify mojo can actually execute, not just that binary exists.

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Verify Mojo - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Check that Mojo is properly installed, accessible from PATH, and the correct version. This verification ensures developers can compile and run Mojo code.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:
- Mojo installation status
- Installed version information
- PATH configuration status
- Any issues found

## Test Success Criteria
- [ ] Detects if Mojo is installed
- [ ] Reports correct version information
- [ ] Identifies PATH issues
- [ ] Provides helpful error messages

## Implementation Steps
1. Check if mojo command is available
2. Run mojo --version to get version info
3. Verify version meets requirements
4. Report results and any issues

## Notes
Check both system and user installations. Suggest installation steps if Mojo not found. Warn if version is too old or too new. Verify mojo can actually execute, not just that binary exists.
