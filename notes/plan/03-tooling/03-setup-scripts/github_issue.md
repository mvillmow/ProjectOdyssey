**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Setup Scripts - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Create automated setup scripts for configuring development environments. These scripts handle Mojo installation, dependency management, environment configuration, and verification to get developers up and running quickly.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Target platform and OS information
- Network connectivity for downloads
- User permissions for installation

## Expected Outputs
- Mojo installed and configured
- Dependencies installed and verified
- Environment variables set correctly
- Git hooks configured
- Verification report confirming setup

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Scripts work across supported platforms
- [ ] Installation is automated and reliable
- [ ] Environment is properly configured
- [ ] Verification catches common issues
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Additional Notes
Make setup as simple as possible - ideally a single command. Handle common errors gracefully with helpful messages. Support both fresh installs and updates to existing environments.
