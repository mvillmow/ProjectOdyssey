**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Environment Setup - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Configure the complete development environment including dependencies, environment variables, and development tools like git hooks. This ensures developers have a consistent, fully-configured workspace.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Project requirements
- System package manager
- Git repository location

## Expected Outputs
- Installed dependencies
- Configured environment variables
- Set up git hooks
- Environment configuration log

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All dependencies are installed
- [ ] Environment is properly configured
- [ ] Git hooks work correctly
- [ ] Setup is documented
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Additional Notes
Use Magic/pixi for package management when possible. Provide fallback for manual dependency installation. Make environment configuration persistent. Test git hooks after installation.

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Environment Setup - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Configure the complete development environment including dependencies, environment variables, and development tools like git hooks. This ensures developers have a consistent, fully-configured workspace.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:
- Installed dependencies
- Configured environment variables
- Set up git hooks
- Environment configuration log

## Test Success Criteria
- [ ] All dependencies are installed
- [ ] Environment is properly configured
- [ ] Git hooks work correctly
- [ ] Setup is documented
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Implementation Steps
1. Install required dependencies
2. Configure environment variables
3. Set up git hooks for automation

## Notes
Use Magic/pixi for package management when possible. Provide fallback for manual dependency installation. Make environment configuration persistent. Test git hooks after installation.
