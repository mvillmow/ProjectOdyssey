**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Configure Environment - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Set up environment variables and configuration files needed for development. This includes paths, API keys (templates), and other settings that control application behavior.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Environment configuration templates
- User-specific settings
- Platform information

## Expected Outputs
- Configured environment variables
- Generated .env files
- Shell configuration updates
- Configuration documentation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All required environment variables are set
- [ ] Configuration persists across sessions
- [ ] Sensitive values use templates/placeholders
- [ ] Clear documentation of configuration

## Additional Notes
Use .env files for local configuration. Never commit actual secrets. Provide .env.example as template. Support both user and project-level configuration. Validate configuration after setup.

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Configure Environment - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Set up environment variables and configuration files needed for development. This includes paths, API keys (templates), and other settings that control application behavior.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:

- [ ] Sensitive values use templates/placeholders
- [ ] Clear documentation of configuration

## Implementation Steps
1. Create environment configuration from templates
2. Set required environment variables
3. Update shell configuration files
4. Document configuration for users

## Notes
Use .env files for local configuration. Never commit actual secrets. Provide .env.example as template. Support both user and project-level configuration. Validate configuration after setup.
