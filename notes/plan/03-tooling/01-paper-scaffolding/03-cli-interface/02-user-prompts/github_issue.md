# GitHub Issues

**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] User Prompts - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Implement interactive prompts to collect paper information from users when not provided via command-line arguments. Prompts guide users through entering required metadata like paper title, author, and description.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Missing argument values
- Prompt definitions and defaults
- Validation rules for each field

## Expected Outputs
- Collected user input
- Validated paper metadata
- Error messages for invalid input

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Prompts are clear and informative
- [ ] Input is validated in real-time
- [ ] Default values are offered where appropriate
- [ ] Error messages help users fix mistakes

## Additional Notes
Make prompts conversational and helpful. Show examples of valid input. Allow users to go back and change previous answers. Support both required and optional fields.

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] User Prompts - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Implement interactive prompts to collect paper information from users when not provided via command-line arguments. Prompts guide users through entering required metadata like paper title, author, and description.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test

- [ ] Error messages help users fix mistakes

## Implementation Steps
1. Determine which values need to be collected
2. Display prompts with helpful descriptions
3. Collect and validate user input
4. Re-prompt on invalid input with error explanation

## Notes
Make prompts conversational and helpful. Show examples of valid input. Allow users to go back and change previous answers. Support both required and optional fields.
