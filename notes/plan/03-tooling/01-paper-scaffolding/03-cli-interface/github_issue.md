# GitHub Issues

**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] CLI Interface - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Build a command-line interface for the paper scaffolding tool that provides an intuitive user experience. The CLI handles argument parsing, prompts users for required information, and formats output in a clear, helpful way.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Command-line arguments
- User input from prompts
- Configuration settings

## Expected Outputs
- Parsed and validated arguments
- Collected paper metadata
- Formatted status messages and results
- Error messages and help text

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Arguments are parsed correctly
- [ ] Prompts guide users through paper creation
- [ ] Output is clear and well-formatted
- [ ] Help text is comprehensive and useful
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Additional Notes
Make the CLI user-friendly with good defaults and clear prompts. Provide helpful error messages. Support both interactive mode (with prompts) and non-interactive mode (all args provided).

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] CLI Interface - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Build a command-line interface for the paper scaffolding tool that provides an intuitive user experience. The CLI handles argument parsing, prompts users for required information, and formats output in a clear, helpful way.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:
- Parsed and validated arguments
- Collected paper metadata

- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Implementation Steps
1. Implement argument parsing for command-line options
2. Create interactive prompts for collecting paper information
3. Format output messages and progress indicators

## Notes
Make the CLI user-friendly with good defaults and clear prompts. Provide helpful error messages. Support both interactive mode (with prompts) and non-interactive mode (all args provided).
