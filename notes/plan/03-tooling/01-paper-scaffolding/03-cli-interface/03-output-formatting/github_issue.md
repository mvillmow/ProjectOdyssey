**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Output Formatting - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Implement clear, well-formatted output for the CLI tool including progress messages, success confirmations, error messages, and result summaries. Good output formatting makes the tool pleasant to use and helps users understand what's happening.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Operation status and results
- Error conditions and messages
- Progress information

## Expected Outputs
- Formatted status messages
- Progress indicators
- Success/error summaries
- Colored output for emphasis

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Output is clear and easy to read
- [ ] Progress indicators show operation status
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and actionable
- [ ] Success summary confirms what was created

## Additional Notes
Use colors sparingly to highlight important information. Keep messages concise but informative. Show file paths for created items. Respect terminal width and formatting capabilities.
