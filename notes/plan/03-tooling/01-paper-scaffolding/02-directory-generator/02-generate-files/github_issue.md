# GitHub Issues

**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Generate Files - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Implement file generation logic that uses templates to create all required files for a new paper implementation. This includes rendering templates with paper-specific metadata and writing files to the appropriate locations.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Rendered template content
- Target file paths
- Paper metadata for file naming

## Expected Outputs
- Generated README.md
- Implementation stub files (.mojo)
- Test file stubs
- Documentation files

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All required files are generated
- [ ] File content is properly rendered from templates
- [ ] Files are placed in correct locations
- [ ] File permissions are set appropriately

## Additional Notes
Generate files in a consistent order (README first, then code, then tests). Ensure generated files are valid (proper encoding, line endings). Don't overwrite existing files without warning.

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Generate Files - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Implement file generation logic that uses templates to create all required files for a new paper implementation. This includes rendering templates with paper-specific metadata and writing files to the appropriate locations.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:
- Generated README.md
- Implementation stub files (.mojo)
- Test file stubs
- Documentation files

## Test Success Criteria
- [ ] All required files are generated
- [ ] File content is properly rendered from templates
- [ ] Files are placed in correct locations
- [ ] File permissions are set appropriately

## Implementation Steps
1. Determine file paths based on directory structure
2. Render each template with paper metadata
3. Write rendered content to target files
4. Set appropriate file permissions

## Notes
Generate files in a consistent order (README first, then code, then tests). Ensure generated files are valid (proper encoding, line endings). Don't overwrite existing files without warning.
