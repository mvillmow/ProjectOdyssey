# GitHub Issues

**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Create Structure - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Implement the core directory creation logic that builds the complete folder hierarchy for a new paper implementation. This includes creating all necessary subdirectories following the repository's established conventions.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Target base directory path
- Paper name for directory naming
- Directory structure specification

## Expected Outputs
- Created directory hierarchy
- Directory creation log
- Error handling for existing directories

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All required directories are created
- [ ] Directory names follow naming conventions
- [ ] Permissions are set correctly
- [ ] Existing directories are handled gracefully

## Additional Notes
Use standard library functions for directory creation. Handle cases where directories already exist without errors. Normalize paper names to valid directory names (lowercase, hyphens instead of spaces).

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Create Structure - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Implement the core directory creation logic that builds the complete folder hierarchy for a new paper implementation. This includes creating all necessary subdirectories following the repository's established conventions.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:
- Created directory hierarchy
- Directory creation log
- Error handling for existing directories

## Test Success Criteria
- [ ] All required directories are created
- [ ] Directory names follow naming conventions
- [ ] Permissions are set correctly
- [ ] Existing directories are handled gracefully

## Implementation Steps
1. Validate target directory path exists and is writable
2. Create main paper directory with normalized name
3. Create standard subdirectories (src, tests, docs, etc.)
4. Set appropriate permissions on created directories

## Notes
Use standard library functions for directory creation. Handle cases where directories already exist without errors. Normalize paper names to valid directory names (lowercase, hyphens instead of spaces).
