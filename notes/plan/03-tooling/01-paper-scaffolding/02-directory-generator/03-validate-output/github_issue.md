# GitHub Issues

**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Validate Output - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Implement validation logic to verify that generated paper structures are complete and correct. This ensures all required directories and files exist, are properly formatted, and follow repository conventions.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Generated directory structure
- Generated files
- Validation checklist and rules

## Expected Outputs
- Validation report with pass/fail status
- List of any missing or invalid items
- Suggestions for fixing issues

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Validation detects missing directories
- [ ] Validation detects missing files
- [ ] Validation checks file format and content
- [ ] Clear report shows any issues found

## Additional Notes
Keep validation simple and focused on essential checks. Provide actionable error messages that tell users exactly what's wrong and how to fix it. Validation should never modify files.

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Validate Output - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Implement validation logic to verify that generated paper structures are complete and correct. This ensures all required directories and files exist, are properly formatted, and follow repository conventions.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:
- Validation report with pass/fail status
- List of any missing or invalid items
- Suggestions for fixing issues

## Test Success Criteria
- [ ] Validation detects missing directories
- [ ] Validation detects missing files
- [ ] Validation checks file format and content
- [ ] Clear report shows any issues found

## Implementation Steps
1. Check all required directories exist
2. Verify all required files are present
3. Validate file content (proper format, no syntax errors)
4. Generate validation report with results

## Notes
Keep validation simple and focused on essential checks. Provide actionable error messages that tell users exactly what's wrong and how to fix it. Validation should never modify files.
