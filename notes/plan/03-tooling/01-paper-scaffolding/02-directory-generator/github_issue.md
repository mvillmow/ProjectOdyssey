**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Directory Generator - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Build the directory generation system that creates the complete folder structure for new paper implementations. The generator ensures all required directories are created in the proper hierarchy and validates the output structure.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Target directory path
- Paper name and metadata
- Directory structure specification
- Repository conventions

## Expected Outputs
- Complete directory hierarchy
- Generated files from templates
- Validation report
- Creation summary

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All required directories are created
- [ ] Files are placed in correct locations
- [ ] Structure matches repository conventions
- [ ] Validation confirms successful creation
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Additional Notes
Follow the established repository structure exactly. The generator should be idempotent - running it multiple times should be safe. Provide clear feedback about what was created.

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Directory Generator - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Build the directory generation system that creates the complete folder structure for new paper implementations. The generator ensures all required directories are created in the proper hierarchy and validates the output structure.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:
- Complete directory hierarchy
- Generated files from templates
- Validation report
- Creation summary

## Test Success Criteria
- [ ] All required directories are created
- [ ] Files are placed in correct locations
- [ ] Structure matches repository conventions
- [ ] Validation confirms successful creation
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Implementation Steps
1. Create the directory structure following repository conventions
2. Generate files from templates in appropriate locations
3. Validate the output structure and files

## Notes
Follow the established repository structure exactly. The generator should be idempotent - running it multiple times should be safe. Provide clear feedback about what was created.
