# GitHub Issues

**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Paper Scaffolding - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Create a CLI tool that generates complete directory structure and boilerplate files for new paper implementations. This scaffolding system uses templates to create consistent paper layouts with all required files, documentation, and test stubs.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Paper title, author, and metadata
- Target directory for new paper
- Template configuration and files
- Repository structure conventions

## Expected Outputs
- Complete paper directory with proper structure
- Generated README.md with paper information
- Implementation stubs (Mojo files)
- Test file templates
- Documentation templates

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Templates can be customized with paper metadata
- [ ] Generator creates complete, valid directory structure
- [ ] CLI provides intuitive interface for paper creation
- [ ] Generated papers follow repository conventions
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Additional Notes
Keep templates simple and focused on essential structure. The tool should make it trivial to start a new paper implementation while enforcing consistency across the repository.

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Paper Scaffolding - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Create a CLI tool that generates complete directory structure and boilerplate files for new paper implementations. This scaffolding system uses templates to create consistent paper layouts with all required files, documentation, and test stubs.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:
- Complete paper directory with proper structure
- Generated README.md with paper information
- Implementation stubs (Mojo files)
- Test file templates
- Documentation templates

## Test Success Criteria
- [ ] Templates can be customized with paper metadata
- [ ] Generator creates complete, valid directory structure
- [ ] CLI provides intuitive interface for paper creation
- [ ] Generated papers follow repository conventions
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Implementation Steps
1. Create a template system for generating paper files
2. Build directory generator to create proper structure
3. Implement CLI interface for user interaction

## Notes
Keep templates simple and focused on essential structure. The tool should make it trivial to start a new paper implementation while enforcing consistency across the repository.
