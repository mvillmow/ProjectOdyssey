**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Create Templates - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Design and create template files for all standard paper components including README, implementation stubs, test files, and documentation. Templates serve as the foundation for generating new paper implementations.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Repository structure conventions
- Standard paper file requirements
- Example paper implementations

## Expected Outputs
- README.md template with paper metadata
- Mojo implementation file templates
- Test file templates
- Documentation templates

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Templates exist for all required paper files
- [ ] Templates include appropriate placeholders
- [ ] Template format is consistent and readable
- [ ] Templates can be easily customized

## Additional Notes
Start with minimal templates that cover the essential structure. Templates should be self-documenting with clear placeholder names like {{PAPER_TITLE}} and {{AUTHOR_NAME}}.

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Create Templates - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Design and create template files for all standard paper components including README, implementation stubs, test files, and documentation. Templates serve as the foundation for generating new paper implementations.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:
- README.md template with paper metadata
- Mojo implementation file templates
- Test file templates
- Documentation templates

## Test Success Criteria
- [ ] Templates exist for all required paper files
- [ ] Templates include appropriate placeholders
- [ ] Template format is consistent and readable
- [ ] Templates can be easily customized

## Implementation Steps
1. Create README template with placeholders for paper info
2. Design Mojo code templates for common patterns
3. Build test file templates with example tests
4. Create documentation templates for usage guides

## Notes
Start with minimal templates that cover the essential structure. Templates should be self-documenting with clear placeholder names like {{PAPER_TITLE}} and {{AUTHOR_NAME}}.
