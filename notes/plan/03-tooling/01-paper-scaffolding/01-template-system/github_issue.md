# GitHub Issues

**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Template System - Design and Documentation
- Body:
```
## Overview
Build a template system for generating paper files with customizable content. Templates use variable substitution to insert paper-specific information like title, author, and date into boilerplate files.

## Objectives
This planning phase will:
- Define detailed specifications and requirements
- Design the architecture and approach
- Document API contracts and interfaces
- Create comprehensive design documentation

## Inputs
- Template file definitions
- Variable substitution rules
- Paper metadata (title, author, etc.)

## Expected Outputs
- Template files for README, Mojo code, tests
- Variable system for content customization
- Template rendering engine

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Templates cover all required paper files
- [ ] Variables can be substituted in templates
- [ ] Rendering produces valid, formatted files
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Additional Notes
Use simple string substitution for templates - no need for complex templating engine. Focus on making templates easy to create and modify.

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Template System - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Overview
Build a template system for generating paper files with customizable content. Templates use variable substitution to insert paper-specific information like title, author, and date into boilerplate files.

## Testing Objectives
This phase focuses on:
- Writing comprehensive test cases following TDD principles
- Creating test fixtures and mock data
- Defining test scenarios for edge cases
- Setting up test infrastructure

## What to Test
Based on the expected outputs:
- Template files for README, Mojo code, tests
- Variable system for content customization
- Template rendering engine

## Test Success Criteria
- [ ] Templates cover all required paper files
- [ ] Variables can be substituted in templates
- [ ] Rendering produces valid, formatted files
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Implementation Steps
1. Create template files for common paper components
2. Define variable system for customization
3. Build rendering engine to generate files from templates

## Notes
Use simple string substitution for templates - no need for complex templating engine. Focus on making templates easy to create and modify.
