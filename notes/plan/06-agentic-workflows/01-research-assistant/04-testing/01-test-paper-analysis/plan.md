# Test Paper Analysis

## Overview

Create tests for the paper analysis capabilities to ensure the agent can correctly extract and summarize information from research papers.

## Parent Plan

[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans

None (implementation level)

## Inputs

- Paper analyzer prompt template
- Sample papers for testing
- Expected analysis outputs
- Testing framework

## Outputs

- Unit tests for paper analysis
- Test cases with sample papers
- Assertions for output quality
- Test documentation

## Steps

1. Collect sample papers for testing
2. Define expected outputs for each paper
3. Write tests for paper analysis prompt
4. Validate output structure and content

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Tests cover various paper types
- [ ] Output structure is validated
- [ ] Key information extraction is verified
- [ ] Tests check for completeness
- [ ] Edge cases are handled
- [ ] All tests pass consistently

## Notes

Test with papers of different lengths and complexity. Verify that XML structure is correct and all required fields are extracted. Check that the analysis is accurate and comprehensive. Test error handling for malformed or incomplete papers.
