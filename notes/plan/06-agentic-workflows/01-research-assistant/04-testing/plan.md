# Testing

## Overview

Create comprehensive tests for all research assistant capabilities including paper analysis, code suggestions, and debugging help. Tests validate prompt templates, workflows, and agent behavior.

## Parent Plan

[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans

- [01-test-paper-analysis/plan.md](01-test-paper-analysis/plan.md)
- [02-test-code-suggestions/plan.md](02-test-code-suggestions/plan.md)
- [03-test-debugging-help/plan.md](03-test-debugging-help/plan.md)

## Inputs

- Implemented agent components
- Prompt templates and workflows
- Sample papers and code for testing
- Testing frameworks and utilities

## Outputs

- Test suite for paper analysis
- Test suite for code suggestions
- Test suite for debugging assistance
- Integration tests for workflows
- Test documentation and coverage reports

## Steps

1. Create tests for paper analysis capabilities
2. Create tests for code suggestion workflows
3. Create tests for debugging assistance
4. Set up continuous testing

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All prompt templates have tests
- [ ] All workflows have integration tests
- [ ] Tests cover happy paths and error cases
- [ ] Test coverage is comprehensive
- [ ] Tests are automated and reproducible
- [ ] Test documentation is clear

## Notes

Test both individual components and end-to-end workflows. Use real paper examples and code samples. Verify that prompts produce consistent, high-quality outputs. Test error handling thoroughly.
