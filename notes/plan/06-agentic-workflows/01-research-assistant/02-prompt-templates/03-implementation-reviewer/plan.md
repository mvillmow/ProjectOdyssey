## Overview

Create a prompt template for reviewing code implementations against paper specifications. The template helps identify correctness issues, missing components, and discrepancies between paper and code.

## Parent Plan

[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans

None (implementation level)

## Inputs

- Paper specifications
- Implementation code
- Understanding of review criteria
- Examples of good code reviews

## Outputs

- Implementation reviewer prompt template
- Review checklist with criteria
- Few-shot examples of reviews
- Structured feedback format
- Suggestion templates for improvements

## Steps

1. Define review criteria and checklist
2. Create structured feedback format
3. Add few-shot review examples
4. Include improvement suggestion patterns

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Template covers all review criteria
- [ ] Feedback format is clear and actionable
- [ ] Checklist ensures comprehensive review
- [ ] Few-shot examples show thorough reviews
