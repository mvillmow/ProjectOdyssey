# Configure Tools

## Overview
Configure the tools available to the research assistant agent for code analysis, file operations, and information retrieval. Define tool permissions, usage patterns, and integration points.

## Parent Plan
[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans
None (implementation level)

## Inputs
- List of available tools for research tasks
- Understanding of tool capabilities
- Knowledge of tool use best practices
- Security and permission requirements

## Outputs
- Tool configuration with permissions
- Usage guidelines for each tool
- Integration patterns for tool chaining
- Error handling for tool failures
- Documentation for tool usage

## Steps
1. Define available tools (file reading, code analysis, search)
2. Configure permissions and access controls
3. Add usage guidelines and examples
4. Define tool chaining patterns

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All necessary tools are configured
- [ ] Permissions are appropriate and secure
- [ ] Usage guidelines are clear
- [ ] Tool chaining patterns are documented
- [ ] Error handling is defined

## Notes
Focus on tools needed for research: reading papers/code, analyzing implementations, searching codebases. Keep permissions minimal but sufficient. Document how tools should be chained for complex tasks.
