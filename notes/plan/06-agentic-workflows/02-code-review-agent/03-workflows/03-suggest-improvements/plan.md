# Suggest Improvements

## Overview
Create a workflow that analyzes code and suggests specific improvements with refactoring examples. The workflow prioritizes suggestions by impact and provides concrete code examples.

## Parent Plan
[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans
None (implementation level)

## Inputs
- Code to analyze
- Review findings from other workflows
- Refactoring patterns and best practices
- Project coding standards

## Outputs
- Prioritized improvement suggestions
- Refactoring examples with before/after code
- Impact assessment for each suggestion
- Implementation difficulty estimates
- Rationale for each improvement

## Steps
1. Analyze code for improvement opportunities
2. Identify applicable refactoring patterns
3. Generate specific suggestions with examples
4. Prioritize by impact and difficulty

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Suggestions are specific and actionable
- [ ] Code examples demonstrate improvements
- [ ] Prioritization considers impact and effort
- [ ] Rationale clearly explains benefits
- [ ] Suggestions follow project standards
- [ ] Workflow handles various code patterns

## Notes
Focus on high-impact improvements: reducing complexity, improving readability, enhancing performance, eliminating duplication. Provide before/after code examples. Explain why each improvement matters. Consider implementation effort.
