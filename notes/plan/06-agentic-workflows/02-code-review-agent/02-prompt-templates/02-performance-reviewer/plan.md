# Performance Reviewer

## Overview
Create a prompt template for reviewing code performance, focusing on algorithmic complexity, efficiency, memory usage, and optimization opportunities. The template guides performance analysis.

## Parent Plan
[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans
None (implementation level)

## Inputs
- Performance review criteria
- Understanding of complexity analysis
- Knowledge of optimization patterns
- Examples of good performance reviews

## Outputs
- Performance reviewer prompt template
- Complexity analysis checklist
- Structured output format with metrics
- Optimization suggestion patterns
- Benchmark recommendation guidelines

## Steps
1. Design output format for performance findings
2. Create complexity analysis checklist
3. Add optimization pattern examples
4. Define performance metrics to track

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Template analyzes algorithmic complexity
- [ ] Memory usage is evaluated
- [ ] Optimization opportunities are identified
- [ ] Suggestions include performance impact
- [ ] Recommendations are specific
- [ ] Template handles various code patterns

## Notes
Focus on: time complexity, space complexity, unnecessary computations, inefficient data structures, memory leaks, I/O bottlenecks. Use chain-of-thought for complexity analysis. Suggest specific optimizations with estimated impact.
