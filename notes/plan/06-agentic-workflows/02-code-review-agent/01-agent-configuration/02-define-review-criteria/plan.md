# Define Review Criteria

## Overview

Define comprehensive review criteria for evaluating code quality across correctness, performance, and style dimensions. Create clear, objective standards that the agent uses to assess code.

## Parent Plan

[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans

None (implementation level)

## Inputs

- Understanding of code quality dimensions
- Best practices for code review
- Knowledge of common code issues
- Examples of good and bad code

## Outputs

- Correctness criteria with examples
- Performance criteria with benchmarks
- Style criteria with guidelines
- Checklist for comprehensive reviews
- Examples of issues to catch

## Steps

1. Define correctness criteria (bugs, logic errors, edge cases)
2. Define performance criteria (complexity, efficiency, memory)
3. Define style criteria (readability, conventions, documentation)
4. Create review checklists

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Criteria are clear and objective
- [ ] All quality dimensions are covered
- [ ] Examples illustrate each criterion
- [ ] Criteria are actionable
- [ ] Checklists ensure thorough reviews

## Notes

Be specific about what to check. Include examples of common issues. Define severity levels for different types of issues. Balance thoroughness with practicality - focus on issues that matter.
