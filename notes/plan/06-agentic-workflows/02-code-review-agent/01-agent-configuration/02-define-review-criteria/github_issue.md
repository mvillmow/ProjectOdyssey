- Performance criteria with benchmarks
- Style criteria with guidelines
- Checklist for comprehensive reviews
- Examples of issues to catch

### Planning Tasks
1. Review and validate the requirements and constraints
2. Design the architecture and component structure
3. Identify dependencies and integration points
4. Document design decisions and rationale
5. Create detailed technical specifications
6. Review plan with stakeholders

### Deliverables
- Detailed design document
- Architecture diagrams (if applicable)
- Technical specifications
- Updated plan.md with any refinements

### Success Criteria
- All design decisions documented and justified
- Architecture is clear and well-defined
- Dependencies identified and documented
- Plan reviewed and approved

**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Define Review Criteria - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Testing Phase: Define Review Criteria

### Objective
Write comprehensive tests following TDD principles for define review criteria.

### Overview
Define comprehensive review criteria for evaluating code quality across correctness, performance, and style dimensions. Create clear, objective standards that the agent uses to assess code.

### Testing Tasks
1. Review success criteria and acceptance requirements
2. Design test cases covering all requirements
3. Write unit tests for individual components
4. Write integration tests for component interactions
5. Create test fixtures and mock data as needed
6. Document test coverage and test scenarios
7. Set up test automation in CI/CD pipeline

### Test Coverage Requirements
- [ ] Criteria are clear and objective
- [ ] All quality dimensions are covered
- [ ] Examples illustrate each criterion
- [ ] Criteria are actionable
- [ ] Checklists ensure thorough reviews

### Deliverables
- Complete test suite (unit and integration tests)
- Test documentation
- Test fixtures and test data
- CI/CD test automation configuration

### Success Criteria
- All tests written before implementation (TDD)
- Test coverage meets project standards
- Tests are automated and reproducible
- Test documentation is clear and complete

**Implementation Issue**:
- Title: [Impl] Define Review Criteria - Implementation
- Body:
```
## Implementation Phase: Define Review Criteria

### Objective
Implement define review criteria according to the design specifications and passing all tests.

### Overview
Define comprehensive review criteria for evaluating code quality across correctness, performance, and style dimensions. Create clear, objective standards that the agent uses to assess code.

### Implementation Steps
1. Define correctness criteria (bugs, logic errors, edge cases)
2. Define performance criteria (complexity, efficiency, memory)
3. Define style criteria (readability, conventions, documentation)
4. Create review checklists

### Expected Outputs
- Correctness criteria with examples
- Performance criteria with benchmarks
- Style criteria with guidelines
- Checklist for comprehensive reviews
- Examples of issues to catch

### Implementation Tasks
1. Review design specifications and test requirements
2. Set up development environment and dependencies
3. Implement core functionality following TDD approach
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Add error handling and edge case management
6. Add logging and monitoring capabilities
7. Write inline documentation and docstrings
8. Conduct code self-review

### Deliverables
- Complete implementation code
- All tests passing
- Inline code documentation
- Error handling and logging

### Success Criteria
- Implementation matches design specifications
- All tests pass successfully
- Code follows project style guidelines
- Error handling is comprehensive
- Code is well-documented

**Packaging Issue**:
- Title: [Package] Define Review Criteria - Integration and Packaging
- Body:
```
## Packaging Phase: Define Review Criteria

### Objective
Package and integrate define review criteria into the broader system.

### Overview
Define comprehensive review criteria for evaluating code quality across correctness, performance, and style dimensions. Create clear, objective standards that the agent uses to assess code.

### Packaging Tasks
1. Review integration points and dependencies
2. Create or update module/package structure
3. Configure build and packaging scripts
4. Update project configuration files (pyproject.toml, magic.toml, etc.)
5. Create integration tests
6. Update import statements and module exports
7. Verify compatibility with existing components
8. Update version numbers and changelog

### Integration Checklist
- [ ] Module properly structured and organized
- [ ] Dependencies documented and configured
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing code
- [ ] Imports and exports properly configured
- [ ] Build/packaging scripts updated

### Deliverables
- Packaged and integrated component
- Updated configuration files
- Integration test results
- Updated changelog

### Success Criteria
- Component successfully integrates with existing system
- All integration tests pass
- No regression in existing functionality
- Package builds successfully
- Documentation updated

**Cleanup Issue**:
- Title: [Cleanup] Define Review Criteria - Refactor and Finalize
- Body:
```
## Cleanup Phase: Define Review Criteria

### Objective
Refactor, optimize, and finalize define review criteria for production readiness.

### Overview
