# Agent Configuration

## Overview
Configure the code review agent with clear review criteria, evaluation standards, and available tools. The configuration defines what aspects of code to review and how to assess quality.

## Parent Plan
[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans
- [01-create-config-file/plan.md](01-create-config-file/plan.md)
- [02-define-review-criteria/plan.md](02-define-review-criteria/plan.md)
- [03-configure-tools/plan.md](03-configure-tools/plan.md)

## Inputs
- Understanding of code review best practices
- Knowledge of quality criteria (correctness, performance, style)
- List of available code analysis tools
- Understanding of configuration formats

## Outputs
- Agent configuration file with complete settings
- Review criteria with clear standards
- Tool configuration with appropriate permissions
- Documentation for configuration options

## Steps
1. Create configuration file with basic structure
2. Define review criteria and evaluation standards
3. Configure available tools for code analysis

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Configuration file is valid and well-structured
- [ ] Review criteria are clear and comprehensive
- [ ] Criteria cover correctness, performance, and style
- [ ] Tool configuration enables thorough analysis
- [ ] Configuration follows best practices

## Notes
Define objective criteria where possible. Be specific about what constitutes good vs. bad code. Include examples of issues the agent should catch. Configure tools for static analysis, linting, and code metrics.
