# Test Performance Review

## Overview

Create tests for the performance review capabilities to ensure the agent correctly identifies inefficiencies, complexity issues, and optimization opportunities.

## Parent Plan

[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans

None (implementation level)

## Inputs

- Performance reviewer prompt template
- Code samples with performance issues
- Expected performance findings
- Testing framework

## Outputs

- Unit tests for performance review
- Test cases with various inefficiencies
- Complexity analysis validation
- Optimization suggestion verification
- Test documentation

## Steps

1. Create test cases with inefficient code
2. Define expected performance findings
3. Write tests for performance review
4. Validate analysis accuracy

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Tests cover complexity issues
- [ ] Inefficiencies are correctly identified
- [ ] Optimization suggestions are appropriate
- [ ] Complexity analysis is accurate
- [ ] Impact estimates are reasonable
- [ ] All tests pass consistently

## Notes

Test with code having various performance issues: inefficient algorithms, unnecessary computations, poor data structures, memory inefficiencies. Verify complexity analysis (O(n), O(n^2), etc.). Check that optimization suggestions are valid.
