# Testing

## Overview

Create comprehensive tests for all documentation agent capabilities including docstring generation, README generation, and tutorial writing. Tests validate documentation quality, completeness, and accuracy.

## Parent Plan

[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans

- [01-test-docstring-quality/plan.md](01-test-docstring-quality/plan.md)
- [02-test-readme-completeness/plan.md](02-test-readme-completeness/plan.md)
- [03-test-tutorial-clarity/plan.md](03-test-tutorial-clarity/plan.md)

## Inputs

- Implemented agent components
- Documentation templates and workflows
- Sample code for testing
- Testing frameworks and utilities

## Outputs

- Test suite for docstring generation
- Test suite for README generation
- Test suite for tutorial creation
- Integration tests for workflows
- Test documentation and coverage reports

## Steps

1. Create tests for docstring quality and completeness
2. Create tests for README generation and accuracy
3. Create tests for tutorial clarity and correctness
4. Set up continuous testing

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All documentation templates have tests
- [ ] All workflows have integration tests
- [ ] Tests validate documentation quality
- [ ] Generated docs follow standards
- [ ] Test coverage is comprehensive
- [ ] Tests are automated and reproducible

## Notes

Test with various code samples. Verify documentation follows standards. Check completeness and accuracy. Ensure examples work correctly. Test edge cases and error handling. Use real-world scenarios.
