**Test Issue**:
- Title: [Test] Define Doc Standards - Write Tests
- Body:
```
## Testing Phase: Define Doc Standards

### Objective
Write comprehensive tests following TDD principles for define doc standards.

### Overview
Define comprehensive documentation standards covering docstrings, API documentation, READMEs, and tutorials. Create clear guidelines for format, completeness, and quality.

### Testing Tasks
1. Review success criteria and acceptance requirements
2. Design test cases covering all requirements
3. Write unit tests for individual components
4. Write integration tests for component interactions
5. Create test fixtures and mock data as needed
6. Document test coverage and test scenarios
7. Set up test automation in CI/CD pipeline

### Test Coverage Requirements
- [ ] Docstring standards are clear and complete
- [ ] API documentation requirements are specified
- [ ] README guidelines cover all sections
- [ ] Tutorial standards ensure clarity

- [ ] Standards are practical and achievable

### Deliverables
- Complete test suite (unit and integration tests)
- Test documentation
- Test fixtures and test data
- CI/CD test automation configuration

### Success Criteria
- All tests written before implementation (TDD)
- Test coverage meets project standards
- Tests are automated and reproducible
- Test documentation is clear and complete

- Tutorial writing standards
- Examples of good documentation

### Implementation Tasks
1. Review design specifications and test requirements
2. Set up development environment and dependencies
3. Implement core functionality following TDD approach
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Add error handling and edge case management
6. Add logging and monitoring capabilities
7. Write inline documentation and docstrings
8. Conduct code self-review

### Deliverables
- Complete implementation code
- All tests passing

**Packaging Issue**:
- Title: [Package] Define Doc Standards - Integration and Packaging
- Body:
```
## Packaging Phase: Define Doc Standards

### Objective
Package and integrate define doc standards into the broader system.

### Overview
Define comprehensive documentation standards covering docstrings, API documentation, READMEs, and tutorials. Create clear guidelines for format, completeness, and quality.

### Packaging Tasks
1. Review integration points and dependencies
2. Create or update module/package structure
3. Configure build and packaging scripts
4. Update project configuration files (pyproject.toml, magic.toml, etc.)
5. Create integration tests
6. Update import statements and module exports
7. Verify compatibility with existing components
8. Update version numbers and changelog

### Integration Checklist

**Cleanup Issue**:
- Title: [Cleanup] Define Doc Standards - Refactor and Finalize
- Body:
```
## Cleanup Phase: Define Doc Standards

### Objective
Refactor, optimize, and finalize define doc standards for production readiness.

### Overview
Define comprehensive documentation standards covering docstrings, API documentation, READMEs, and tutorials. Create clear guidelines for format, completeness, and quality.

### Cleanup Tasks
1. Code review and refactoring
   - Remove dead code and debug statements
   - Improve code clarity and maintainability
   - Apply DRY principles
   - Optimize performance bottlenecks

2. Documentation finalization
   - Complete API documentation
   - Update README and usage guides
   - Add examples and tutorials
   - Document known issues and limitations
