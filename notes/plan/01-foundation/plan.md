# Foundation

## Overview
Establish the foundational structure and configuration for the Mojo AI Research Repository. This includes creating the complete directory structure, setting up configuration files for the Mojo/MAX environment, and writing initial documentation to guide contributors.

## Parent Plan
None (top-level)

## Child Plans
- [01-directory-structure/plan.md](01-directory-structure/plan.md)
- [02-configuration-files/plan.md](02-configuration-files/plan.md)
- [03-initial-documentation/plan.md](03-initial-documentation/plan.md)

## Inputs
- Empty repository with basic Git setup
- Understanding of Mojo/MAX project requirements
- Knowledge of repository structure best practices

## Outputs
- Complete directory structure for papers, shared code, and supporting files
- Configuration files (magic.toml, pyproject.toml, .gitignore, .gitattributes)
- Initial documentation (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Git LFS setup for large model files

## Steps
1. Create the complete directory structure with papers, shared, and supporting directories
2. Set up configuration files for Magic package manager and Python tooling
3. Configure Git settings including ignore patterns, attributes, and LFS
4. Write initial documentation to guide repository usage and contributions

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All required directories exist with proper structure
- [ ] Configuration files are valid and properly formatted
- [ ] Git is configured to handle ML artifacts appropriately
- [ ] Documentation clearly explains repository purpose and usage
- [ ] All child plans are completed successfully

## Notes
This is the first major milestone of the repository. Keep everything simple and straightforward - avoid over-engineering. Focus on creating a solid foundation that can be built upon later.
