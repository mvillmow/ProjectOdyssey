# Write Standards

## Overview
Define coding standards, style guidelines, and best practices for the repository. This ensures code consistency, quality, and maintainability across all contributions.

## Parent Plan
[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans
None (leaf node)

## Inputs
- Tool configurations are in place
- Understanding of coding best practices
- Knowledge of Mojo and Python standards

## Outputs
- Standards section in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Code style guidelines
- Documentation standards
- Testing requirements
- Commit message conventions

## Steps
1. Document code style guidelines (refer to black, ruff configs)
2. Define documentation standards for code and APIs
3. Specify testing requirements and coverage expectations
4. Establish commit message conventions
5. Provide examples of good practices

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Standards are clearly defined and practical
- [ ] Code style expectations are documented
- [ ] Testing requirements are specified
- [ ] Examples illustrate good practices
- [ ] Standards align with tool configurations

## Notes
Standards should be clear but not overly restrictive. Focus on practices that improve code quality and maintainability. Provide rationale for important standards.
