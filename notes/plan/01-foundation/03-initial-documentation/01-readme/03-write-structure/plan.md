# Write Structure

## Overview

Write the repository structure section of the README that explains how the repository is organized. Document the purpose of major directories and how they relate to each other.

## Parent Plan

## Child Plans

None (leaf node)

## Inputs

- Complete directory structure exists
- Understanding of each directory's purpose
- Knowledge of how components relate

## Outputs

- Structure section in README.md
- Directory tree visualization
- Explanation of each major directory
- Guidance on where to find different types of content

## Steps

1. Create visual directory tree of main structure
2. Explain purpose of papers/ directory
3. Explain purpose of shared/ directory
4. Document supporting directories (benchmarks, docs, agents, tools, configs)
5. Describe how directories relate and work together

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Structure section clearly explains organization
- [ ] Directory tree is accurate and helpful
- [ ] Each major directory's purpose is documented
- [ ] Readers can easily navigate the repository

## Notes

Good structure documentation helps contributors know where to put their code and where to find things. Use a clear directory tree and concise explanations for each major section.
