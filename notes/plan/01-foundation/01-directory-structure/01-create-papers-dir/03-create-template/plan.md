# Create Template

## Overview

Create a template directory structure that can be copied for each new paper implementation. The template should include standard subdirectories, placeholder files, and a README explaining how to use it.

## Parent Plan

[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans

None (leaf node)

## Inputs

- papers/ directory exists
- Understanding of what each paper implementation needs
- Knowledge of standard project structure

## Outputs

- papers/_template/ directory
- Standard subdirectories (src/, tests/, data/, configs/, notebooks/)
- Template README.md explaining the structure
- Placeholder files showing expected organization

## Steps

1. Create _template/ directory inside papers/
2. Create standard subdirectories for paper implementations
3. Add placeholder files demonstrating expected structure
4. Write template README explaining how to use the template

## Success Criteria

- [ ] _template/ directory exists in papers/
- [ ] All standard subdirectories are created
- [ ] Template README explains usage clearly
- [ ] Template can be copied easily for new papers

## Notes

The template should be simple but complete. Include all directories a paper implementation might need, even if some remain empty initially.
