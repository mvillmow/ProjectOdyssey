# Create Papers Directory

## Overview
Set up the papers directory structure which will contain individual paper implementations. Create the base directory, add a README explaining its purpose, and provide a template structure that can be copied for each new paper implementation.

## Parent Plan
[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans
- [01-create-base-dir/plan.md](01-create-base-dir/plan.md)
- [02-create-readme/plan.md](02-create-readme/plan.md)
- [03-create-template/plan.md](03-create-template/plan.md)

## Inputs
- Repository root directory exists
- Understanding of paper implementation requirements
- Knowledge of what structure each paper needs

## Outputs
- papers/ directory at repository root
- papers/README.md explaining directory purpose and usage
- papers/_template/ directory with standard structure for new papers

## Steps
1. Create the papers base directory at repository root
2. Write README explaining how papers directory works
3. Create template directory with standard structure for paper implementations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] papers/ directory exists at repository root
- [ ] README clearly explains the purpose and usage
- [ ] Template structure is complete and documented
- [ ] Template can be easily copied for new paper implementations

## Notes
The papers directory is where each individual paper implementation lives. Each paper should be self-contained but can use shared components. The template should make it easy to start a new paper implementation.
