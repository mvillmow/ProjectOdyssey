# Directory Structure

## Overview
Create the complete directory structure for the Mojo AI Research Repository, including the papers directory for individual implementations, the shared directory for reusable components, and supporting directories for benchmarks, documentation, agents, tools, and configurations.

## Parent Plan
[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans
- [01-create-papers-dir/plan.md](01-create-papers-dir/plan.md)
- [02-create-shared-dir/plan.md](02-create-shared-dir/plan.md)
- [03-create-supporting-dirs/plan.md](03-create-supporting-dirs/plan.md)

## Inputs
- Repository root directory exists
- Understanding of project organization requirements
- Knowledge of separation between papers and shared code

## Outputs
- papers/ directory with README and template
- shared/ directory with core, training, data, and utils subdirectories
- benchmarks/, docs/, agents/, tools/, and configs/ directories
- README files in each major directory explaining its purpose

## Steps
1. Create papers directory structure with template and documentation
2. Create shared directory with all subdirectories for reusable components
3. Create supporting directories for benchmarks, docs, agents, tools, and configs

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All directories exist in the correct locations
- [ ] Each major directory has a README explaining its purpose
- [ ] Template structure is in place for new paper implementations
- [ ] Directory structure matches the project plan exactly

## Notes
Keep the structure simple and logical. Each directory should have a clear, single purpose. The papers directory is for individual paper implementations, while shared is for code reused across papers.
