# Create Supporting Directories

## Overview
Create additional supporting directories that provide infrastructure for the repository. This includes directories for benchmarks, documentation, agents, development tools, and configuration files.

## Parent Plan
[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans
- [01-benchmarks/plan.md](01-benchmarks/plan.md)
- [02-docs/plan.md](02-docs/plan.md)
- [03-agents/plan.md](03-agents/plan.md)
- [04-tools/plan.md](04-tools/plan.md)
- [05-configs/plan.md](05-configs/plan.md)

## Inputs
- Repository root directory exists
- Understanding of supporting infrastructure needs
- Knowledge of what additional directories are required

## Outputs
- benchmarks/ directory for performance testing
- docs/ directory for detailed documentation
- agents/ directory for AI agent configurations
- tools/ directory for development utilities
- configs/ directory for configuration files
- README files in each directory

## Steps
1. Create benchmarks directory for performance testing code
2. Create docs directory for comprehensive documentation
3. Create agents directory for AI agent configurations
4. Create tools directory for development utilities
5. Create configs directory for configuration files

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All supporting directories exist at repository root
- [ ] Each directory has a README explaining its purpose
- [ ] Directory structure is organized and logical
- [ ] All directories are ready for content

## Notes
These directories provide infrastructure that supports the main work in papers and shared. Keep them organized and well-documented so contributors know where to place different types of content.
