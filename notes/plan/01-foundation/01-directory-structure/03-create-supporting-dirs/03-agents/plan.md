## Overview
Create the agents/ directory for AI agent configurations, prompts, and agent-related code. This directory will contain configurations for various AI coding agents and automation tools used in development.

## Parent Plan
[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans
None (leaf node)

## Inputs
- Repository root directory exists
- Understanding of AI agent usage in development
- Knowledge of agent configurations needed

## Outputs
- agents/ directory at repository root
- agents/README.md explaining agent setup and usage
- Subdirectories for different agent types or configurations
- Example configurations or templates

## Steps
1. Create agents/ directory at repository root
2. Write README explaining agent directory purpose
3. Document agent configuration approach
4. Provide examples or templates for agent setup

## Success Criteria
- [ ] agents/ directory exists at repository root
- [ ] README clearly explains agent configurations
- [ ] Documentation helps set up and use agents
- [ ] Structure supports various agent types

## Notes
AI agents can assist with development tasks. Keep agent configurations version-controlled and documented so the team can share effective agent setups.
