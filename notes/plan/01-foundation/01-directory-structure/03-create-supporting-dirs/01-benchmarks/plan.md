# Benchmarks

## Overview

Create the benchmarks/ directory for performance testing, evaluation scripts, and benchmark results. This directory will contain code to measure and compare performance of different implementations.

## Parent Plan

[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans

None (leaf node)

## Inputs

- Repository root directory exists
- Understanding of benchmarking needs
- Knowledge of what performance metrics to track

## Outputs

- benchmarks/ directory at repository root
- benchmarks/README.md explaining purpose and usage
- Structure for benchmark scripts and results

## Steps

1. Create benchmarks/ directory at repository root
2. Write README explaining benchmarking approach and usage
3. Document expected structure for benchmark scripts
4. Provide guidelines for running and reporting benchmarks

## Success Criteria

- [ ] benchmarks/ directory exists at repository root
- [ ] README clearly explains benchmarking purpose
- [ ] Documentation guides how to add new benchmarks
- [ ] Structure supports organized benchmark results

## Notes

Benchmarks help compare different implementations and track performance improvements. Keep benchmarks reproducible with clear instructions and environment specifications.
