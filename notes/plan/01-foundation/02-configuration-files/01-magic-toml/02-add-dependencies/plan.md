## Parent Plan

[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans

None (leaf node)

## Inputs

- magic.toml base file exists
- Knowledge of Mojo/MAX dependencies
- Understanding of required Python packages

## Outputs

- magic.toml with dependencies section
- All required packages specified with versions
- Dependencies organized logically

## Steps

1. Add dependencies section to magic.toml
2. Specify MAX and Mojo requirements
3. Add Python and common ML library dependencies
4. Document why each dependency is needed

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All necessary dependencies are listed
- [ ] Version constraints are appropriate
- [ ] Dependencies are organized clearly
- [ ] Comments explain dependency choices

## Notes

Include only essential dependencies. Avoid over-specifying versions unless necessary for compatibility. Document any version constraints.
