- Outline configuration requirements
- Plan testing strategies

## Expected Inputs
N/A

## Expected Outputs
N/A

## Success Criteria
- [ ] CI workflow runs tests on every pull request
- [ ] Paper validation catches structural issues
- [ ] Benchmark workflow compares against baseline
- [ ] Security scans report vulnerabilities
- [ ] All workflows complete within reasonable time
- [ ] Status badges display in README

## Notes
- Use workflow caching to speed up builds
- Run workflows in parallel when possible
- Provide clear failure messages
- Use matrix builds for multiple Mojo versions if needed
- Keep workflows maintainable and well-documented
