# Compare Baseline

## Overview

Compare current benchmark results against baseline measurements to detect performance regressions or improvements.

## Parent Plan

[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans

None (leaf node)

## Inputs

- [To be determined]

## Outputs

- Completed compare baseline

## Steps

1. [To be determined]

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Accurate comparison against baseline
- [ ] Regressions detected with configurable threshold
- [ ] Improvements also highlighted
- [ ] Clear indication of performance changes
- [ ] Statistical significance considered

## Notes

Use percentage-based thresholds (e.g., >5% slower is regression). Store baseline in Git LFS or separate storage. Update baseline on merge to main. Consider statistical tests for significance.
