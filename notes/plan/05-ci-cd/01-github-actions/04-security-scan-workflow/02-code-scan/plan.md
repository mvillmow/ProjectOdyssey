# Code Scan

## Overview

Perform static analysis on source code to identify security vulnerabilities, unsafe patterns, and potential exploits.

## Parent Plan

[../plan.md](../plan.md)

## Child Plans

None (leaf node)

## Inputs

- [To be determined]

## Outputs

- Completed code scan

## Steps

1. [To be determined]

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Static analysis runs on all code
- [ ] Common security issues detected
- [ ] False positives minimized
- [ ] Clear descriptions of issues
- [ ] Integration with GitHub Code Scanning

## Notes

Use GitHub CodeQL if Mojo is supported, otherwise use language-agnostic tools like semgrep. Focus on common vulnerabilities: injection, buffer overflows, unsafe file operations, credential exposure.
