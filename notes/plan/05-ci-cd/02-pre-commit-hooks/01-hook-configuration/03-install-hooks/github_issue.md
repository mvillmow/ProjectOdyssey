```
## Overview
Create installation instructions and scripts to make it easy for developers to set up pre-commit hooks on their local machines.

## Planning Tasks

### Design Decisions
- Review the requirements and constraints for Install Hooks
- Document architectural decisions and design patterns
- Identify dependencies and integration points
- Define interfaces and contracts

### Documentation
- Create detailed technical specifications
- Document API designs and data structures
- Outline configuration requirements
- Plan testing strategies

## Expected Inputs
- Pre-commit configuration file
- Project setup documentation
- Developer environment requirements

## Expected Outputs
- Hook installation instructions
- Installation script (optional)
- Troubleshooting guide

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Clear installation instructions
- [ ] Installation works on fresh repository clone
- [ ] Instructions cover all platforms
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide available
- [ ] Skip/bypass instructions documented

## Notes
Installation: pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install. Add to onboarding docs. Mention git commit --no-verify to skip hooks. Include pre-commit run --all-files for manual runs.
