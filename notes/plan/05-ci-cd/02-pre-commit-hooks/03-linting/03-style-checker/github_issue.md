**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] Style Checker - Design and Documentation
- Body: 
```
## Overview
Configure style checking for Mojo code to enforce naming conventions, code organization, and project-specific style guidelines.

## Planning Tasks

### Design Decisions
- Review the requirements and constraints for Style Checker
- Document architectural decisions and design patterns
- Identify dependencies and integration points
- Define interfaces and contracts

### Documentation
- Create detailed technical specifications
- Document API designs and data structures
- Outline configuration requirements
- Plan testing strategies

## Expected Inputs
- Mojo source files
- Style guidelines
- Convention rules

## Expected Outputs
- Style violation reports
- Convention warnings
- Improvement suggestions

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Style checker enforces naming conventions
- [ ] Import ordering validated
- [ ] Line length limits enforced
- [ ] Clear messages for style violations
- [ ] Consistent code style across project

## Notes
Check: snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for types, import ordering, docstring presence, line length (80-120 chars). Balance strictness with productivity.
