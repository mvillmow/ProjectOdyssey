**Plan Issue**:
- Title: [Plan] 02: Pre-commit Hooks - Design and Documentation
- Body: 
```
## Overview
Set up pre-commit hooks that run locally before commits to catch formatting, linting, and style issues early, improving code quality and reducing CI failures.

## Planning Tasks

### Design Decisions
- Review the requirements and constraints for 02: Pre-commit Hooks
- Document architectural decisions and design patterns
- Identify dependencies and integration points
- Define interfaces and contracts

### Documentation
- Create detailed technical specifications
- Document API designs and data structures
- Outline configuration requirements
- Plan testing strategies

## Expected Inputs
N/A

## Expected Outputs
N/A

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks installed and configured
- [ ] All file types formatted consistently
- [ ] Linting catches common issues
- [ ] Hooks run in under 10 seconds
- [ ] Clear documentation for installation
- [ ] Hooks are optional but encouraged

## Notes
- Use pre-commit framework for Python-based hooks
- Keep hooks fast to avoid slowing down commits
- Provide easy installation instructions
- Allow developers to skip hooks when needed (--no-verify)
- Focus on auto-fixable issues when possible
