- Identify dependencies and integration points
- Define interfaces and contracts

### Documentation
- Create detailed technical specifications
- Document API designs and data structures
- Outline configuration requirements
- Plan testing strategies

## Expected Inputs
N/A

## Expected Outputs
N/A

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All GitHub Actions workflows running successfully
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks installed and enforcing standards
- [ ] Issue and PR templates guiding contributors
- [ ] Automated tests run on every pull request
- [ ] Security scans catch vulnerabilities early
