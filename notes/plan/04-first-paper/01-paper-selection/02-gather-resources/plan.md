# Gather Resources

## Overview

Collect all necessary resources for implementing LeNet-5, including the original paper, reference implementations in other frameworks, and develop understanding of the architecture.

## Parent Plan

[Parent](../plan.md)

## Child Plans

- [01-download-paper](./01-download-paper/plan.md)
- [02-find-reference-implementations](./02-find-reference-implementations/plan.md)
- [03-understand-architecture](./03-understand-architecture/plan.md)

## Inputs

- Download the original LeNet-5 paper
- Find reference implementations
- Study and understand the architecture

## Outputs

- Completed gather resources
- Download the original LeNet-5 paper (completed)

## Steps

1. Download Paper
2. Find Reference Implementations
3. Understand Architecture

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Original paper PDF obtained
- [ ] At least 2 reference implementations found
- [ ] Architecture fully understood
- [ ] Resources organized in project

## Notes

- Paper: "Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition" (1998)
- Look for modern PyTorch/TensorFlow implementations
- Understand differences from original (if any)
- Note architecture details and hyperparameters
