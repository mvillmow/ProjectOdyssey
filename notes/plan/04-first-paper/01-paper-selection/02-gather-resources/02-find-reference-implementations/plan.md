## Child Plans

None (leaf node)

## Inputs

- Find PyTorch implementation
- Find TensorFlow implementation
- Review and validate implementations

## Outputs

- Completed find reference implementations

## Steps

1. Find PyTorch implementation
2. Find TensorFlow implementation
3. Review and validate implementations

## Success Criteria

- [ ] At least 2 reference implementations found
- [ ] Implementations reviewed and validated
- [ ] Links documented in project
- [ ] Key differences noted

## Notes

- Look for official or well-maintained repos
- Prefer implementations with good documentation
- Check that they achieve expected accuracy
- Note any modifications from original paper
