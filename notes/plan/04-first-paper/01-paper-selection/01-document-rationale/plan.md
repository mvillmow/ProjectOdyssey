# Document Rationale

## Overview

Document the rationale for selecting LeNet-5 as the first paper implementation, outline the requirements for first paper selection, and define clear success criteria for the implementation.

## Parent Plan
[Parent](../plan.md)

## Child Plans
- [01-why-lenet](./01-why-lenet/plan.md)
- [02-requirements](./02-requirements/plan.md)
- [03-success-criteria](./03-success-criteria/plan.md)

## Inputs
- Explain why LeNet-5 is ideal for first implementation
- List requirements that led to this choice
- Define what success looks like

## Outputs
- Completed document rationale
- Explain why LeNet-5 is ideal for first implementation (completed)

## Steps
1. Why LeNet
2. Requirements
3. Success Criteria

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Rationale clearly explains LeNet-5 choice
- [ ] Requirements are documented
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Document is reviewed and approved

## Notes
- LeNet-5 is foundational to CNNs
- Architecture is simple and well-documented
- MNIST dataset is accessible
- Paper is publicly available
- Many reference implementations exist
