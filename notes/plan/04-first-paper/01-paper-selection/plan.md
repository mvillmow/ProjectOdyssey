# Paper Selection

## Overview

Select LeNet-5 as the first paper to implement, document the rationale for this choice, gather all necessary resources including the paper and reference implementations, and create the project structure.

## Parent Plan
[Parent](../plan.md)

## Child Plans
- [01-document-rationale](./01-document-rationale/plan.md)
- [02-gather-resources](./02-gather-resources/plan.md)
- [03-create-structure](./03-create-structure/plan.md)

## Inputs
- Document why LeNet-5 is the ideal first paper
- Gather the original paper and supporting resources
- Find reference implementations for comparison
- Create the project structure for implementation

## Outputs
- Completed paper selection
- Document why LeNet-5 is the ideal first paper (completed)

## Steps
1. Document Rationale
2. Gather Resources
3. Create Structure

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Rationale for LeNet-5 selection documented
- [ ] Original paper PDF obtained
- [ ] Reference implementations identified
- [ ] Project structure created and initialized
- [ ] Documentation templates ready

## Notes
- LeNet-5 is chosen for being foundational and simple
- Original 1998 paper is publicly available
- MNIST dataset is small and easy to work with
- Architecture is well-documented with many references
