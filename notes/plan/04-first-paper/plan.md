# First Paper Implementation - LeNet-5

## Overview

Implement the LeNet-5 convolutional neural network from the seminal 1998 paper "Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition" by Yann LeCun et al. This is our first complete paper implementation, demonstrating the full workflow from paper selection to trained model.

## Inputs

- Select and justify LeNet-5 as the first paper to implement
- Implement the complete LeNet-5 architecture in Mojo
- Build a training pipeline with loss functions and optimizers
- Create a data pipeline for MNIST dataset
- Achieve reproducible results matching the paper
- Document the implementation thoroughly

## Outputs

- Completed first paper implementation - lenet-5
- Select and justify LeNet-5 as the first paper to implement (completed)

## Steps

1. Paper Selection
2. Model Implementation
3. Training Pipeline
4. Data Pipeline
5. Testing
6. Documentation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] LeNet-5 architecture correctly implemented
- [ ] Model trains on MNIST dataset
- [ ] Achieves >98% test accuracy
- [ ] Training is reproducible with fixed seeds
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Complete documentation for reproduction

## Notes

- This is our first complete paper implementation
- Focus on correctness over optimization
- Keep implementations simple and readable
- Follow the paper specifications as closely as possible
- Document any deviations from the paper
