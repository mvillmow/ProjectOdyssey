# Test Layers

## Overview

Write comprehensive unit tests for each layer implementation to verify correctness of convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.

## Parent Plan
[Parent](../plan.md)

## Child Plans
None (leaf node)

## Inputs
- Test conv layer independently
- Test pooling layer independently
- Test FC layer independently

## Outputs
- Completed test layers

## Steps
1. Test conv layer independently
2. Test pooling layer independently
3. Test FC layer independently

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Conv layer tests pass
- [ ] Pooling layer tests pass
- [ ] FC layer tests pass
- [ ] All edge cases covered
- [ ] Tests are comprehensive

## Notes
- Test with known inputs/outputs
- Test different batch sizes
- Test edge cases (zeros, large values)
- Compare with reference implementations
