# Model Implementation

## Overview

Implement the complete LeNet-5 architecture including all core layers (convolution, pooling, fully connected), assemble them into the full model architecture, and write comprehensive tests for all components.

## Parent Plan
[Parent](../plan.md)

## Child Plans
- [01-core-layers](./01-core-layers/plan.md)
- [02-model-architecture](./02-model-architecture/plan.md)
- [03-model-tests](./03-model-tests/plan.md)

## Inputs
- Implement convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers
- Build the complete LeNet-5 architecture
- Implement forward pass through the network
- Initialize model parameters correctly
- Test all components thoroughly

## Outputs
- Completed model implementation
- Implement convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers (completed)

## Steps
1. Core Layers
2. Model Architecture
3. Model Tests

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All layer types implemented correctly
- [ ] Forward pass produces correct output shapes
- [ ] Parameters initialized properly
- [ ] All layer tests pass
- [ ] Model architecture matches paper specification
- [ ] Output tensor shapes validated

## Notes
- Follow paper specifications exactly
- Use simple, readable implementations
- No optimization at this stage
- Focus on correctness
- Document any deviations from paper
