# Gradient Computation

## Overview

Implement gradient computation for the loss function to enable backpropagation during training.

## Parent Plan

[Parent](../plan.md)

## Child Plans

None (leaf node)

## Inputs

- Implement backward pass for loss
- Compute gradients correctly
- Verify with finite differences

## Outputs

- Completed gradient computation

## Steps

1. Implement backward pass for loss
2. Compute gradients correctly
3. Verify with finite differences

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Gradients computed correctly
- [ ] Finite difference check passes
- [ ] Gradients flow backward
- [ ] Tests pass

## Notes

- Gradient of cross-entropy: softmax - one_hot
- Use finite differences to verify
- Check gradient shapes
- Ensure numerical stability
