# Test Loss

## Overview

Write comprehensive tests for the loss function to verify correctness with known inputs and edge cases.

## Parent Plan
[Parent](../plan.md)

## Child Plans
None (leaf node)

## Inputs
- Test loss with known input/output pairs
- Test edge cases
- Verify numerical stability

## Outputs
- Completed test loss

## Steps
1. Test loss with known input/output pairs
2. Test edge cases
3. Verify numerical stability

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Loss tests pass
- [ ] Known cases produce correct loss
- [ ] Edge cases handled correctly
- [ ] Numerical stability verified

## Notes
- Test with perfect predictions (loss ≈ 0)
- Test with random predictions
- Test with one-hot labels
- Verify gradient computation later
