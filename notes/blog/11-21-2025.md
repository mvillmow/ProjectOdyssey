# 11-21-2025: The moment of truth


So the goal of this experiment was to see if I could agentically generate a training framework with a language that I don't know. This is a fairly aggressive experiment that I think will show once and for all what an agentic toolchain can do in the hands of someone that already knows how to program. I'm already running into limits of the agentic workflow, some which have been pointed out by others, but in the grand scheme of things, they are rather minor since I can resolve them fairly quickly.

## Issues discovered

Here are some of the issues that I have ran into:

 * Over complexity in project isn't as high as it used to be, but it is definitely there.
 * Duplication of files needs cleanup.
 * Its easy to just keep pushing, until you just push and push and lose track of where you are.
 * Out of date code/references. Since i'm using mojo and its changing fairly frequently, the language version being generated is no longer valid for the compiler being used. Slower moving languages won't have this problem.
 * Generated files/notes can liter the code base, so requires cleanup.
 * Tests/binaries can be told that they are 'working', but the llm can lie or not even run it.


All of these things are solvable with more thorough analysis, but that isn't what I am doing. I'm seeing how quickly I can generate a complex project that works. This also means that fixing these issues isn't a blocker, it just means I have more things to fix. Given that typing code is no longer the bottlneck, engineering debt cleanup is also no longer a bottleneck.


## Training hiccup

Once I got the setup scripts working, i started my training run, and ran into the first problem.
