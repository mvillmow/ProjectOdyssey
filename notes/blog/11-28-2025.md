# 11-28-2025: Finally got CI/CD green

It took more time than I had expected, but I finally got CI/CD green. I was able to get training to work properly on the 23rd, and since then, I had to put forth 143 more commits with multiple fixes per commit just to get all the testing and infrastructure green. I talked about this earlier, and this was due to me rushing commits just to use up the 1000$ of free credits from Anthropic. It actually was a lot harder than I had expected to use the credits, so I heavily relaxed any quality controls. Now that I have everything passing, I can start adding more models and features. I'm going to focus on Lenet for a bit and then alexnet, since these are fundamental and easy to train on a laptop. I plan on going a little more public with this once this step is complete. I'll also make checks required for commit, so everything stays green from now on.
