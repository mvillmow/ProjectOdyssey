# 11-23-2025: Training and cleanup

I was able to properly train mnist network with the emnist dataset and get success rates similar enough to the research that I feel that I am on the right track. I'll discuss more on this later, but there are things that I need to clean up first.


## Training output

Just a quick output of what the training output looks like:


```bash
============================================================
LeNet-5 Training on EMNIST Dataset

## Cleanup

One of the bad parts of my experiment with this agentic flow is that there is a lot of documentation being created that I haven't properly gotten the agents to place in the right spot when they create it. I was hoping to use the markdown as a form of memory, but that isn't working how I want mostly because the agent's just aren't reliably creating them. I'll spend the next few days validating all the changes since my agentic workflow is hitting its limit soon. I'll do an analysis on it tomorrow along with some more information on what the workflow is.
