## TL;DR

Got LeNet-5 training successfully on EMNIST with results matching published research (10 epochs, 112,800 training samples, 18,800 test samples, 47 classes, batch size 32, learning rate 0.001). The model works. The code works. But the agentic workflow that generated it is hitting hard limits. The biggest issue: agents aren't reliably creating documentation in the right places, and using markdown as agent memory isn't working. Next few days will be validation, cleanup, and deep analysis of where the agentic workflow succeeded and where it failed.

**Key success:** LeNet-5 training completed with results close enough to research to validate correctness.

**Key failure:** Documentation placement is unreliable, markdown-as-memory isn't working, agents hitting systematic limits.

## The Success: Training Works

After fixing the conv2d segfault from Day Twelve, I got the training working.

### Training Configuration

```bash
./train --epochs 10 --batch-size 32 --lr 0.001
```

Output:

```bash
============================================================
LeNet-5 Training on EMNIST Dataset
============================================================

Configuration:
  Epochs:  10
  Batch Size:  32
  Learning Rate:  0.001
  Data Directory:  datasets/emnist
  Weights Directory:  lenet5_weights

Initializing LeNet-5 model...
  Model initialized with 47 classes

Loading EMNIST dataset...
  Training samples:  112800
  Test samples:  18800

Starting training...
Epoch [ 1 / 10 ]
  Batch [ 100 / 3525 ] - Loss:  3.9881823
....
```

### Why This Matters

This validates the entire experiment:

- **Agents can generate working ML code** - The LeNet-5 implementation is correct enough to train
- **Mojo code generation is viable** - Despite not knowing the language, agents produced functional code
- **Research paper implementation works** - Results are close enough to published research to confirm correctness
- **The foundation is solid** - Forward pass, backward pass, gradient computation all work

The code works. The model trains. The experiment proves agents can build what humans don't know how to build.

## The Failure: Documentation Chaos

But here's the problem: the process that generated this working code is breaking down.

### The Documentation Problem

The agents aren't reliably placing documentation in the right locations:

- Files created in random locations
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Missing cross-references
- Duplicate content across multiple files
- No clear single source of truth

### The Memory Experiment Failure

I tried using markdown files as a form of agent memory - a place where agents could read and write context across sessions. The idea was:

- Agents write findings to markdown
- Other agents read those findings
- Knowledge persists across agent invocations
- Documentation stays in sync with code

**It didn't work.**

Why it failed:

1. **Agents don't consistently check existing docs** - They create new files instead of updating existing ones
2. **Agents don't follow placement rules reliably** - Even with explicit instructions in `CLAUDE.md`, files end up in wrong locations
3. **Agents don't cross-reference** - No linking between related documents
4. **Agents don't maintain** - Old docs go stale, no cleanup happens

The markdown-as-memory approach needs rethinking.

---

## The Cleanup Phase

Next few days are validation and cleanup:

### What Needs Cleanup

1. **Documentation placement** - Move files to correct locations per documentation organization rules
2. **Duplicate removal** - Find and merge duplicate content
3. **Cross-referencing** - Add proper links between related docs
4. **Stale content removal** - Delete outdated or superseded documentation
5. **Naming consistency** - Standardize file names and directory structure

### What Needs Validation

1. **Code correctness** - Verify all generated code actually works
2. **Test coverage** - Ensure tests actually test what they claim to test
3. **Documentation accuracy** - Check that docs match current code state
4. **Agent configurations** - Validate agent YAML frontmatter and delegation patterns
5. **Workflow compliance** - Ensure 5-phase workflow was followed correctly

This is a manual process. The agents can't be trusted to do it reliably.

## The Analysis Coming Tomorrow

I'll do a comprehensive analysis of the agentic workflow tomorrow, covering:

### What Worked

- Code generation in unfamiliar language (Mojo)
- Research paper implementation
- Complex ML algorithms (conv2d, backprop, gradient descent)
- Multi-component system integration
- Fast iteration speed

### What Didn't Work

- Documentation placement
- Markdown-as-memory approach
- Consistent agent behavior
- Default to parallel execution
- Reliable test generation
- Technical debt management

### Where the Limits Are

- What tasks agents handle well
- What tasks agents struggle with
- What requires human oversight
- What can be automated vs what can't
- Where the human bottleneck shifted to

The experiment proved agents can build working ML code. Now we need to understand the boundaries of what's practical.

## Three Realizations

### Realization 1: Success Doesn't Mean the Process Works

The code works. Training succeeds. Results match research. But the process that created this is hitting limits. Just because the output is correct doesn't mean the workflow is sustainable.

**The lesson:** Judge workflows by their reliability and repeatability, not just their occasional successes.

### Realization 2: Documentation Is the Weak Link

When agents generate code fast, documentation becomes the bottleneck:

- **Code generation:** Fast, mostly reliable
- **Test generation:** Fast, somewhat reliable
- **Documentation generation:** Fast, unreliable placement and maintenance

The faster agents generate code, the harder it becomes to keep docs in sync. And when docs are in the wrong places, they're worse than useless—they're misleading.

**The lesson:** Documentation placement and maintenance needs different tooling than code generation.

### Realization 3: Memory Requires Structure

The markdown-as-memory experiment failed because memory isn't just writing things down—it's:

- Writing to the right place
- Reading from the right place
- Updating instead of duplicating
- Cleaning up stale information
- Maintaining references between related pieces

Agents can write. Agents can read. But agents struggle with the structural coordination that makes memory useful.

**The lesson:** Agent memory needs explicit coordination mechanisms, not just files on disk.

---

## What's Next

Immediate priorities:

1. **Manual documentation cleanup** - Move files to correct locations per `/notes/`, `/agents/`, `/notes/review/` organization
2. **Duplicate removal** - Find and merge duplicate content across the repository
3. **Validation pass** - Verify all code actually works as claimed
4. **Workflow analysis** - Write comprehensive analysis of what worked and what didn't
5. **Process improvements** - Design better documentation placement and memory mechanisms
6. **Agent coordination fixes** - Address default-to-sequential behavior
7. **End-to-end testing** - Build tests that validate real workflows, not just units

The code works. Now make the process work.

---

## Reflections

This day taught me about the gap between "working output" and "working process":

1. **Success at the task level doesn't mean success at the process level** - The code works, but the workflow that created it is unsustainable. Individual wins don't add up to systematic success.
2. **Documentation is harder to automate than code** - Agents can generate code reliably but struggle with documentation placement, maintenance, and coordination. Structure is harder than syntax.
3. **Memory requires more than writing** - Markdown-as-memory failed because memory needs placement discipline, update discipline, cleanup discipline, and reference discipline. Writing is the easy part.
4. **Manual cleanup is still necessary** - Even with agents, humans need to validate, reorganize, and maintain structural consistency. The agent can't be trusted to maintain its own output.
5. **Limits are valuable** - Finding where agents hit limits is as valuable as finding where they succeed. Knowing the boundaries is essential for practical use.

The training works. The model learns. The results match research. The experiment succeeded in proving agents can build working ML systems in unfamiliar languages. But the process needs work before it's repeatable and sustainable.
