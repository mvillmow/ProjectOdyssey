## TL;DR

Realized I'd built the entire agent system and infrastructure without explicitly documenting the
development principles that should guide it. Spent the day fixing that oversight: added KISS, YAGNI,
TDD, DRY, SOLID, Modularity, and POLA to CLAUDE.md with explanations and references. Single focused
commit. Pull request #1555 merged quickly. This is what happens when you're moving fast and forget to
write down the rules you're already following.

**Key commits:** [`3b94bbd`](https://github.com/mvillmow/ml-odyssey/commit/3b94bbd) (coding principles)

## Wait, Where Are The Principles?

Day 5 was a sprint. Day 6 started quiet, and that's when it hit me:

**I built a six-level agent hierarchy, designed an entire infrastructure, established development
workflows, and never once wrote down the principles that should guide all of it.**

I had been *following* these principles the whole time—the agent system follows SOLID, the cleanup
focused on DRY, the scripts handle YAGNI. But they weren't documented. They weren't in CLAUDE.md where
the whole team (which is currently me, but theoretically could be more) would see them.

That's a big gap.

Most good developers already know these things. They're foundational. But here's the thing: **if you
don't write them down, people don't follow them consistently.** Especially when moving fast, when
you're tired, or when you're juggling multiple priorities.

So I fixed it.

## Seven Principles That Should Have Been There From Day One

I added a "Key Development Principles" section to CLAUDE.md with seven core principles that every
decision should check against:

**KISS** - Keep It Simple Stupid. The simplest solution that works beats elegant complexity.

**YAGNI** - You Ain't Gonna Need It. Don't build features you *might* need. Build what you need
*now*.

**TDD** - Test Driven Development. Write tests first, then code. Tests clarify intent and catch
regressions.

**DRY** - Don't Repeat Yourself. Each piece of knowledge should have one authoritative place. (Day 5
taught me this the hard way.)

**SOLID** - Five architectural principles rolled into one: Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov
Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion.

**Modularity** - Independent modules through well-defined interfaces. This is why the agent hierarchy
works at all.

**POLA** - Principle of Least Astonishment. Interfaces should be intuitive. Don't surprise users
(including future you).

None of these are original ideas. They're decades old. But that's the point—they're *proven* because
they work. The fact that I was already following them meant I should have just written them down
earlier.

## Why I Forgot And Why It Matters

I was moving fast:

- Day 1: Build the planning structure (331 files, 1,655 potential issues)
- Day 2: Set up automation (scripts for issue creation)
- Day 3-4: Create the agent system (48 agents across 6 levels)
- Day 5: Cleanup marathon (1,100+ errors, rebuild after hitting token limits)

By that point, I was deep in execution mode. Principles feel abstract when you're in the weeds. You
don't think "I'm following SOLID today," you think "let me make this specialist agent handle one
responsibility."

But without writing them down, they're not *shared*. They're just what I happen to be doing. And
that's fragile.

Here's what I learned: **write down the principles *before* you're in deep execution.** Or at least,
do it as soon as you notice you're *already* following them.

## The Commit

Small, focused:

```text
docs: add coding principles to CLAUDE.md
```

What went in:

- "Key Development Principles" section with all seven principles explained
- Why each principle matters for *this project specifically*
- Four reference links for developers who want to dive deeper:
  - Core Principles of Software Development
  - 7 Common Programming Principles
  - Software Development Principles
  - Clean Coding Principles
- Also added `*.swp` to .gitignore (vim swap files—preventing future annoyances)

Small change. But it's a change that should have been there on Day 1.

---

## What's Next

Immediate priorities:

1. **Audit the Agent System** - Make sure all 48 agents actually follow these principles
2. **Code Review Against Principles** - Day 5's cleanup code should check against these standards
3. **Mojo Implementation** - When we write the neural network code, start with KISS, not complexity
4. **Test Infrastructure** - TDD means we need solid testing framework first
5. **Documentation Consistency** - Every doc should reflect these principles

## Reflections

This day was a reminder that **obvious things need to be written down.**

I knew these principles. I was following them. But they weren't documented, which means:

- New developers wouldn't know them
- I might slip on them under pressure
- There's no shared reference point for discussing trade-offs

The best practices in your head aren't practices—they're just habits. Writing them down turns them
into *principles*, which is stronger.

Also? It felt good to pause and do one thing well. Day 5 was about volume. Day 6 was about clarity.
Both are necessary, but clarity is easier to remember.

**Status:** Development principles documented and committed. Foundation now has both code and
philosophy.

**Next:** Audit existing system against principles, prepare for Mojo implementation

**Stats:**

- 1 commit (focused, intentional)
- 7 core principles documented
- 4 external references added
- 1 major oversight corrected
- 1 developer who remembered to breathe
