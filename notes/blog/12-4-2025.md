# 12-4-2025: Lazy updates

I've been lazy to do updates. Mostly I've been working on cleaning things up based on some feedback from others. Most of the feedback is offline, so not really tracking it anywhere. The crazy part of this entire thing is how quickly I can go from review -> issue -> implementation -> PR -> main -> review. The cycle is insanely fast. Right now there is quite a lot of code, but I've been reducing it quite heavily by better fine tuning how the agents track data.  There are other things I need to review before I get into the core code and developing the model I want to develop.


## Improvements

### CI/CD

I need to further improve the CI/CD flow. I'm glad it is running, but it seems I can reduce the amount of time by merging some flows together. 

<Agent insert stats from github for CI/CD in last week and provide a quick analysis>


### Code debt

There is some code debt, so I need to fix the issues, but a lot of them are unimplemented features and not bugs. I don't think it will ever get to zero, but the current number seems high.

These are tracked by CI/CD and look like this:

```Text
Technical Debt Markers
Marker	Count
TODO	372
FIXME	14
```

### Code duplication

I've been de-duplicating code this week, and the amount of reduction has been pretty significant, but there still seems to be more code duplication that can be cleaned up. I'm also thinking of pulling ExTensor out into its own repository and just exposing the package and interface to ml-odyssey just to reduce the amount of changes that occur. I think this sort of repackaging and modularization will benefit development of agents since the only thing that really matters is the interface and the descriptions of the interface and what they do. The implementation isn't important, but that is the case for software development in general.

<Agent look at the last 20 pull requests and provide 1-2 examples of de-duplication that happened>

### Struct duplication

There also seems to be a lot of structs, which duplicating them has always been a problem with agents. I'll take a pass this weekend on de-duplicating them to see what needs to happen. I'll be filing github issues, and then having the agent flesh out the github issue with actual analysis from the repository. This will be a very simple workflow.

<Agent find some duplication and give examples here>


### Optimization

I'm almost to the point where I want to optimize the CPU path to speed up training. I want to make single thread near speed of light on CPU using all of the features of the cores I have on my laptop, and then focus on using multiple threads, and then split off to multiple devices. I'll create a benchmarking framework or extend what is already here. It might be a seperate repo so as not to pollute the current repository. What we have right now is:

<Agent, insert current benchmarking structure>
