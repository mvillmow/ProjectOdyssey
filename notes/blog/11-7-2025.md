## TL;DR

First day of the ML Odyssey project: went "all in" on upfront planning, generated 331 hierarchical plan documents, and immediately learned two valuable lessons about LLM-assisted development. Built automation scripts to manage ~1,655 potential GitHub issues, shipped my first test issues ([#2-6](https://github.com/mvillmow/ml-odyssey)), and designed a 6-level agent hierarchy to orchestrate the entire implementation.

## Day One: The "Go Big" Approach

This is my first devlog entry for the ML Odyssey project. Day one was all about **setup and planning**—no code written yet, just pure infrastructure work.

I made a deliberate (possibly crazy) decision: **plan the entire project upfront instead of doing anything incremental**. This is a "go big or go home" experiment, so naturally, I went big.

The result? A complete 4-level hierarchical planning structure spanning:
- **6 major sections** (foundation, shared-library, tooling, first-paper, ci-cd, agentic-workflows)
- **331 plan documents** covering every component
- **~1,655 potential GitHub issues** (5 issues per component × 331 components)

Yeah, I know. That's a lot.

## First Discovery: The Template Error

Almost immediately, I discovered a flaw in my approach. An error in one part of my prompt duplicated across *everything*. Normally, this would be catastrophic—imagine manually fixing 331 files.

But here's where LLM-assisted development shines: **it gets fixed asynchronously while I work on something else**.

### The Problem

I had auto-generated `github_issue.md` files from a template and applied this template to every plan document. With 331 plan documents in the entire hierarchy, the number of issue files was... substantial.

### The Solution

I wrote a more complete script ([`scripts/regenerate_github_issues.py`](../scripts/regenerate_github_issues.py)) that could regenerate all the files correctly:

```python
# Regenerate all issue files from plan sources
python3 scripts/regenerate_github_issues.py --dry-run
```

The script is 446 lines of Python that:
- Extracts all sections from `plan.md` files
- Generates 5 issues per component (Plan, Test, Implementation, Packaging, Cleanup)
- Supports dry-run, section-by-section, and resume modes

Then I removed the generated files from version control and just checked in the generation script itself. Problem solved. See commit [`08aa73a`](https://github.com/mvillmow/ml-odyssey/commit/08aa73a).

**Lesson learned:** A little sloppiness is acceptable when you can iterate at LLM speed.

---

## Second Discovery: Where Do Plans Live?

The second issue was about the 331 plan files themselves. My initial thinking:

> "I'll keep these in the repository so I can go back and look at the plan or use it to learn from."

But then I had a realization while sitting on Caltrain (not my most focused thinking environment): **once I file the GitHub issues, I can keep all the status updates there**. The plans don't need to be in the repo—GitHub becomes the source of truth.

### What Changed

1. Added `notes/plan/` to `.gitignore` ([commit `4632abc`](https://github.com/mvillmow/ml-odyssey/commit/4632abc))
2. Removed plan files from version control ([commit `615b2ae`](https://github.com/mvillmow/ml-odyssey/commit/615b2ae))
3. Updated prompts to specify that status updates go to GitHub issues, not local files

Now I have:
- **Local plan files** (not in git) for initial generation
- **GitHub issues** (in GitHub) as the living source of truth
- **Generation scripts** (in git) to recreate plans if needed

This keeps the repository clean while maintaining full traceability. The main automation script ([`scripts/create_issues.py`](../scripts/create_issues.py), 865 lines) handles:
- Automatic label creation with color coding
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Progress tracking and state management
- Updating markdown files with created issue URLs

I already ran a test batch and successfully created issues [#2-6](https://github.com/mvillmow/ml-odyssey/issues) on GitHub.

**Lesson learned:** Let each system do what it does best. GitHub for tracking, git for code, local files for generation.

## The 6-Level Agent Hierarchy

The next big step is getting the agentic workflow up and running. This will be a multi-level hierarchy of agents, with each level having different responsibilities and scope.

Here's the architecture I'm planning:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Level 0: Chief Architect                  │
│  (Strategic Planning & Oversight)          │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                   │
       ┌───────────┴───────────┐
       ↓                       ↓
┌─────────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────────┐
│ Level 1: Section    │  │ Level 1: Section    │
│ Orchestrators       │  │ Orchestrators       │
│ (Tactical)          │  │ (Tactical)          │
└──────────┬──────────┘  └──────────┬──────────┘
           │                        │
           ↓                        ↓
    ┌─────────────┐          ┌─────────────┐
    │ Level 2:    │          │ Level 2:    │
    │ Module      │          │ Module      │
    │ Design      │          │ Design      │
    │ (Arch)      │          │ (Arch)      │
    └──────┬──────┘          └──────┬──────┘
           │                        │
           ↓                        ↓
    ┌─────────────┐          ┌─────────────┐
    │ Level 3:    │          │ Level 3:    │
    │ Component   │          │ Component   │
    │ Specialists │          │ Specialists │
    └──────┬──────┘          └──────┬──────┘
           │                        │
           ↓                        ↓
    ┌─────────────┐          ┌─────────────┐
    │ Level 4:    │          │ Level 4:    │
    │ Impl.       │          │ Impl.       │
    │ Engineers   │          │ Engineers   │
    └──────┬──────┘          └──────┬──────┘
           │                        │
           ↓                        ↓
    ┌─────────────┐          ┌─────────────┐
    │ Level 5:    │          │ Level 5:    │
    │ Junior      │          │ Junior      │
    │ Engineers   │          │ Engineers   │
    └─────────────┘          └─────────────┘
```

### Level Responsibilities

- **Level 0 (Chief Architect):** Strategic planning, cross-section coordination, technical leadership
- **Level 1 (Section Orchestrators):** Tactical planning for major sections (foundation, tooling, etc.)
- **Level 2 (Module Design):** Architectural design for modules within sections
- **Level 3 (Component Specialists):** Detailed design for individual components
- **Level 4 (Implementation Engineers):** Writing the actual code, tests, and documentation
- **Level 5 (Junior Engineers):** Boilerplate generation, repetitive tasks, scaffolding

The Chief Architect (Level 0) is like a technical lead for the entire project and guides the rest of the hierarchy. This should allow me to systematically work through 5-10 GitHub issues at a time before moving to the next batch.

This architecture is defined in [`.clinerules`](../.clinerules) and will integrate with the 5-phase workflow documented in [`notes/review/README.md`](../notes/review/README.md).

## What's Next

Immediate priorities:

1. **Finalize the agent hierarchy implementation** (Level 0-5 structure)
2. **Create remaining GitHub issues** using `scripts/create_issues.py`
3. **Set up the Chief Architect agent** to begin orchestrating work
4. **Start the first iteration** on foundation components
5. **Test the 5-phase workflow** (Plan → Test/Implementation/Packaging → Cleanup)

The foundation is laid. Now comes the fun part: watching this massive hierarchy actually work.

---

## Reflections

This experiment is already teaching me things:

1. **LLM speed changes the calculus** on what "mistakes" are acceptable
2. **Infrastructure decisions emerge** through doing, not just planning
3. **The right abstractions** (GitHub for tracking, scripts for generation) make scaling possible
4. **Going big** is risky but also kind of exhilarating

I should probably have figured out the GitHub-as-source-of-truth thing earlier, but I was on Caltrain, so I'm giving myself a pass.

Let's see where this goes.

**Status:** Planning complete, automation ready, no actual code written yet
**Next:** Build the agentic orchestration layer
