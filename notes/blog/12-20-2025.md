## TL;DR

Build system polish day. Fixed pixi and just to install and run correctly, cleaned up agents and unified justfile commands, renamed ml-odyssey to ProjectOdyssey in the codebase, and removed dead/duplicate/legacy documentation. Also fixed broken pre-commit hooks and formatted missed Python files.

**Key insight:** A clean build system reduces friction for everyone—time spent polishing pays dividends in developer productivity.

## Pixi and Just Integration

### Fixed Installation

```bash
# Before: manual steps
pip install -e .
mojo build shared -o shared.mojopkg

# After: single command
pixi install
just build
```

### Unified Commands

```justfile
# All common operations
build:          # Build the project
test:           # Run tests
format:         # Format all code
pre-commit:     # Run pre-commit hooks
shell:          # Open development shell
```

---

## Project Rename

Renamed ml-odyssey → ProjectOdyssey across codebase:

```bash
# Files updated
- pyproject.toml
- pixi.toml
- docker-compose.yml
- CI workflows
- Documentation
```

This aligns with the project's evolving identity.

## Documentation Cleanup

Removed dead, duplicate, and legacy documentation:

| Removed | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Legacy notes | Superseded by GitHub issues |
| Duplicate READMEs | Consolidated to single source |
| Dead links | Referenced non-existent files |
| Outdated guides | No longer accurate |

---

## Agent Cleanup

Cleaned up agent configurations:

- Unified justfile command patterns
- Removed deprecated agent references
- Standardized agent tooling

---

## Pre-commit Fixes

Fixed broken pre-commit hooks:

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: mojo-format
        name: Format Mojo files
        entry: mojo format
        language: system
        files: \.mojo$
        pass_filenames: true  # Fixed: was missing
```

### Python Formatting

Formatted Python files that were missed:

```bash
ruff format scripts/
ruff check scripts/ --fix
```

## What's Next

### Immediate Priorities

1. **CI optimization** - Faster build times
2. **Developer docs** - Getting started guide
3. **Contribution guide** - How to contribute

---

## Reflections

1. **Names matter** - ProjectOdyssey better reflects the journey
2. **Dead docs mislead** - Better to remove than leave outdated
3. **Build friction kills adoption** - Make it easy to get started

---

**Status:** Build system polished, project renamed, docs cleaned up

**Next:** CI optimization, developer docs, contribution guide

### Stats

- **Commits:** 12
- **Build commands unified:** pixi + just integration
- **Files renamed:** ml-odyssey → ProjectOdyssey
- **Docs removed:** Dead, duplicate, legacy
- **Pre-commit fixes:** Hook installation and configuration
