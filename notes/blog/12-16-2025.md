## TL;DR

Lighter day focused on continuous refinement and maintenance. Updated GitHub Actions dependencies, bumped the github-actions group with 4 updates, reorganized autograd tape module backward implementations, and applied tensor ops to subtract_backward. Small but important maintenance work that keeps the CI/CD pipeline healthy.

**Key insight:** Small maintenance days are just as important as big feature days—technical debt accumulates when you skip them.

## GitHub Actions Updates

Bumped the github-actions group with 4 updates:

```yaml
# Updated dependencies
- actions/checkout: v3 → v4
- actions/setup-python: v4 → v5
- actions/cache: v3 → v4
- other CI-related actions
```

Benefits:
- Security patches
- Performance improvements
- New features
- Better Node.js compatibility

## Autograd Tape Reorganization

Reorganized backward implementations in the tape module:

```mojo
# Before: all backward ops in tape.mojo
struct Tape:
    fn backward(...): ...
    fn _conv_backward(...): ...
    fn _linear_backward(...): ...
    # ... 30+ backward implementations

# After: separated by operation type
# tape.mojo - core tape logic
# backward/conv.mojo - convolution backward
# backward/linear.mojo - linear backward
```

This improves maintainability as the number of operations grows.

---

## Tensor Ops for Subtract Backward

Applied tensor ops pattern to subtract_backward:

```mojo
# Before: manual loop
fn subtract_backward(grad: ExTensor, ctx: Context) -> List[ExTensor]:
    var grad_a = grad.clone()
    var grad_b = ExTensor.zeros_like(grad)
    for i in range(grad.numel()):
        grad_b.store(i, -grad.load(i))
    return [grad_a, grad_b]

# After: tensor ops
fn subtract_backward(grad: ExTensor, ctx: Context) -> List[ExTensor]:
    return [grad, -grad]  # Uses overloaded negation
```

Cleaner and potentially faster with SIMD negation.

## What's Next

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Continue reorganization** - More backward op separation
2. **Dependency audit** - Check for outdated packages
3. **CI optimization** - Reduce workflow runtime

---

## Reflections

1. **Maintenance prevents decay** - Regular updates avoid big migrations
2. **Organization scales** - 30 operations in one file is too many
3. **Small improvements compound** - Tensor ops beat manual loops

---

**Status:** Dependencies updated, tape module reorganized, subtract backward optimized

**Next:** Continue reorganization, dependency audit, CI optimization

### Stats

- **Commits:** 13
- **GitHub Actions updates:** 4 dependency bumps
- **Modules reorganized:** autograd tape backward implementations
- **Operations optimized:** subtract_backward
