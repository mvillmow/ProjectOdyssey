# 12-31-2025 - End of a year

So this year has been interesting. We have went from Agents barely able to code large projects to agents being able to implement a full training framework in a new language. There are definitely improvements, but the next year will be crazy. I'll continue working on the stuff I want to do on the side, but my agentic flows are becoming more and more complete. The problem is now just keeping the workflows running and in a safe manner. I've only had one catastrophe happen this year, but since everything is backed up on github, i'm not too worried about it. This is one of the benefits of running on WSL. Most of my important documents are stored somewhere else. Its almost like a container.

I've been working on my other projects more and more, so will be publishing something on them soon. I planned on having the first item done today, but I a few days delayed won't hurt anything. Anyways, I'll be re-focusing on training and validating models soon, now that bug fixing and feature development seems to have been finished. The project is well tested and cleaned up, so will have to move to the next step which is agent validation.
