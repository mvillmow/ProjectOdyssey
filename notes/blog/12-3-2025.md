## TL;DR

Integration day—connecting all the pieces. Fixed ~250 Mojo compilation errors across the shared library, integrated VGG-16, LeNet, AlexNet, and ResNet-18 models, consolidated the TrainingLoop implementation, and migrated documentation to GitHub-only issue tracking. Also fixed critical CI compilation errors for Mojo v0.25.7+ compatibility.

**Key insight:** Integration is where abstractions meet reality—every interface assumption gets tested when components actually connect.

## Compilation Error Fixes

Fixed ~250 Mojo compilation errors:

### Categories of Fixes

| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Trait conformance | ~50 | Missing Dataset trait methods |
| Transfer operators | ~40 | List[ExTensor] return values |
| Type annotations | ~35 | Missing raises keywords |
| Import errors | ~30 | Circular dependencies |
| Syntax updates | ~95 | v0.25.7+ compatibility |

### Key Patterns

```mojo
# Transfer operator for non-copyable types
fn get_tensors(self) -> List[ExTensor]^:  # Note the ^
    return self.tensors^

# Trait conformance
struct FileDataset(Dataset):  # Must implement all trait methods
    fn __len__(self) -> Int: ...
    fn __getitem__(self, idx: Int) -> ...: ...
```

## Model Integration

Integrated all classic CNN architectures:

- **LeNet** - Working with EMNIST
- **AlexNet** - ImageNet-style architecture
- **VGG-16** - Deep but simple
- **ResNet-18** - First residual network

Each model now uses the consolidated TrainingLoop and shared components.

---

## TrainingLoop Consolidation

Unified all training logic:

```mojo
struct TrainingLoop:
    fn train(mut self, epochs: Int, train_loader: DataLoader,
             val_loader: Optional[DataLoader]) raises -> TrainingResult:
        for epoch in range(epochs):
            var train_loss = self.train_epoch(train_loader)
            var val_loss = self.validate(val_loader) if val_loader else None
            self.callbacks.on_epoch_end(epoch, train_loss, val_loss)
            if self.early_stopper.should_stop():
                break
        return TrainingResult(...)
```

### Features

- Epoch-based training with validation
- Callback integration (logging, checkpointing, early stopping)
- Shared evaluation metrics module
- Model utilities for weight persistence

---

## Documentation Migration

Moved to GitHub-only issue documentation:

- Removed local `notes/plan/` directory
- All planning now in GitHub issues
- Use `gh issue view` and `gh issue comment`

This reduces duplication and keeps documentation where developers already work.

---

## CI/CD Fixes

Fixed CI for Mojo v0.25.7+ compatibility:

- Updated syntax patterns in all test files
- Fixed FP4 type test compilation errors
- Added raises keyword to test functions
- Updated review agents to post directly to GitHub PRs

---

## What's Next

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Training validation** - Run all models end-to-end
2. **Performance profiling** - Identify bottlenecks
3. **Documentation sync** - Update all docs to match implementation

---

## Reflections

1. **Integration reveals assumptions** - Every interface gets tested
2. **Compilation errors cluster** - One fix often reveals ten more
3. **Documentation belongs where devs work** - GitHub issues > local files

---

**Status:** ~250 compilation errors fixed, models integrated, training consolidated

**Next:** Training validation, performance profiling, documentation sync

### Stats

- **Commits:** 53
- **Compilation errors fixed:** ~250
- **Models integrated:** LeNet, AlexNet, VGG-16, ResNet-18
- **CI fixes:** v0.25.7+ compatibility
- **Documentation:** Migrated to GitHub-only
