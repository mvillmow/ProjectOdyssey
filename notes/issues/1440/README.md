## Implementation Notes

## Overview
Create the base configuration file for the research assistant agent with proper structure and format. The file defines the agent's settings, metadata, and initialization parameters.

- Verify compatibility with other components
- Package for deployment/distribution

## Integration Requirements

- Configuration file with proper structure
- Basic agent metadata (name, version, description)
- Initialization settings
- Schema validation for configuration

## Integration Steps
1. Create configuration file with proper format (YAML or TOML)
2. Add agent metadata and version information
3. Define initialization settings and defaults
4. Add schema validation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Configuration file has valid syntax
- [ ] Metadata is complete and accurate
- [ ] File follows standard configuration patterns
- [ ] Schema validates configuration structure

## Notes
Use a simple, readable format. Include comments to explain each configuration option. Keep defaults sensible and conservative.
