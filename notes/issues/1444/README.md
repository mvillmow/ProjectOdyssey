## Implementation Notes

## Overview
Define the research assistant's role, purpose, and behavioral constraints. This includes the agent's primary responsibilities, limitations, and guidelines for interaction following Claude best practices.

## Implementation Goals
- Implement the functionality to pass all tests
- Follow Mojo best practices and coding standards
- Ensure code is clean, documented, and maintainable
- Meet all requirements specified in the plan

## Required Inputs
- Understanding of research assistant responsibilities
- Claude best practices for role definition
- Knowledge of appropriate constraints
- Examples of effective role prompts

## Expected Outputs
- Clear role definition with purpose statement
- Behavioral constraints and limitations
- Interaction guidelines
- Examples of appropriate/inappropriate behavior

## Implementation Steps
1. Write clear role definition describing agent purpose
2. Define behavioral constraints to prevent issues
3. Add guidelines for appropriate interactions
4. Include examples of good and bad behavior

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Role definition is clear and specific
- [ ] Constraints prevent hallucination and inappropriate responses
- [ ] Guidelines cover common interaction scenarios
- [ ] Examples illustrate expected behavior
- [ ] Definition follows Claude best practices

## Notes
Use structured prompts with XML tags. Be specific about what the agent should and should not do. Focus on being helpful for research tasks while maintaining accuracy and not hallucinating.
