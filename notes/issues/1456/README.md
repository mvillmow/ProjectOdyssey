## Implementation Notes

## Overview
Configure the research assistant agent with a clear role definition, constraints, and available tools. The configuration uses structured formats to define the agent's purpose, capabilities, and limitations following Claude best practices.

## Cleanup Objectives
- Refactor code for optimal quality and maintainability
- Remove technical debt and temporary workarounds
- Ensure comprehensive documentation
- Perform final validation and optimization

## Cleanup Tasks
- Code review and refactoring
- Documentation finalization
- Performance optimization
- Final testing and validation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Configuration file is valid and well-structured
- [ ] Role definition clearly states agent purpose
- [ ] Constraints prevent inappropriate behavior
- [ ] Tool configuration specifies available capabilities
- [ ] Configuration follows Claude best practices

## Notes
Keep configuration simple and clear. The role should be specific enough to guide behavior but flexible enough to handle various research tasks. Constraints should prevent hallucination and ensure factual responses.
