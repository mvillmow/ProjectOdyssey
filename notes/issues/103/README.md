# Issue #103: [Plan] Magic TOML - Design and Documentation

This is a duplicate of issues #87-91 which completed all 5 phases for magic.toml.

**Why Complete:** The magic.toml file was designed, tested, implemented, packaged, and cleaned up in issues #87-91. That work included:
- **#87 (Plan):** Complete design specification for Magic package manager configuration
- **#88 (Test):** Test file `tests/config/test_magic_toml.py` with TOML validation
- **#89 (Impl):** Created `/magic.toml` (25 lines) with project metadata and Mojo version requirements
- **#90 (Package):** Integration with Magic package manager
- **#91 (Cleanup):** Final validation and documentation

**Result:** `/magic.toml` exists with complete configuration (project metadata, Mojo version, commented placeholders for dependencies/channels).

**Status:** COMPLETE (all work covered by #87-91)
