# ADR-001: Pragmatic Hybrid Language Approach for Tooling and Automation

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-11-10

**Issue Reference**: [Issue #8](https://github.com/mvillmow/ml-odyssey/issues/8) - Mojo Script Conversion Feasibility Assessment

**Decision Owner**: Chief Architect

## Executive Summary

This ADR establishes a **Pragmatic Hybrid Language Approach** for the ML Odyssey project, resolving the conflict
between the project's "Mojo First" philosophy and the practical limitations of Mojo v0.25.7 for automation and
tooling tasks.

**Core Decision**: Use the right tool for the job. Mojo for ML/AI implementations and performance-critical code;
Python for automation tasks that require subprocess output capture, regex parsing, or GitHub API interaction.

**Strategic Rationale**: Project velocity and reliability are more important than philosophical consistency. Python is
the right tool for automation - Mojo's subprocess API lacks exit code access (causing silent failures) and regex
support is not production-ready.

## Context

### The Philosophical Conflict

The ML Odyssey project was established with a "Mojo First" philosophy as documented in CLAUDE.md:

> **Rule of Thumb**: If you're asking "Should I use Mojo or Python?", the answer is Mojo. Python requires justification.

This philosophy was grounded in valid technical reasons:

- Performance: 10-100x faster for ML workloads
- Type safety: Catch errors at compile time
- Memory safety: Built-in ownership and borrow checking
- Consistency: One language across the project
- Future-proof: Designed for AI/ML from the ground up

The Chief Architect guidelines reinforced this:

> **Critical**: ALL new scripts, tools, and automation MUST be written in Mojo unless there's explicit
> justification documented in the issue.

### The Technical Reality

Issue #8 conducted a comprehensive feasibility assessment to convert the project's Python automation scripts
(1,502 LOC) to Mojo. The assessment revealed critical blockers:

**CRITICAL BLOCKER - No Exit Code Access (Silent Failures)**:

Mojo's `subprocess.run()` can capture stdout but has NO access to exit codes, causing dangerous silent failures:

```python
# Python (current - SAFE)
result = subprocess.run(['gh', 'issue', 'create', ...], capture_output=True)
if result.returncode != 0:
    raise Exception(f"Command failed: {result.stderr}")
issue_url = result.stdout.strip()

# Mojo (UNSAFE - Silent Failures)
from subprocess import run
var output = run("false")  # Exit code 1 - NO ERROR RAISED!
var output = run("exit 42")  # Exit code 42 - NO ERROR RAISED!
var output = run("gh issue create ...")  # If this fails, no way to detect!
```text

**Testing Evidence**: Created test scripts (`test_mojo_capabilities.mojo`, `test_exit_code.mojo`) that prove:

- ✓ stdout capture works: `run()` returns String output
- ✗ Exit code access: NOT AVAILABLE - failures are silent
- ✗ Error detection: No exceptions on non-zero exit
- ⚠️ stderr capture: Only via shell redirect (`2>&1`)

Without exit code access, scripts cannot detect command failures, making automation unreliable and unsafe.

### HIGH RISK - Regex Not Production-Ready

The scripts use 15+ regex patterns for markdown parsing. While a third-party `mojo-regex` library exists
([mojo-regex on GitHub](https://github.com/msaelices/mojo-regex)), it is explicitly **not production-ready**:

```python
# Python regex patterns used throughout scripts
ISSUE_SECTION_PATTERN = re.compile(
    r'^(?:##\s+|\*\*)(Plan|Test|Implementation)...',
    re.MULTILINE
)
title_match = re.search(r'\*\*Title\*\*:\s*`([^`]+)`', content)
labels = re.findall(r'`([^`]+)`', labels_text)
```text

**mojo-regex limitations**:

- Early development stage (author warns: "not yet feature-complete and may contain bugs")
- Missing: compile(), case-insensitive matching, lookaheads, backreferences
- Not available in pixi (installation failed during testing)
- Manual string parsing would be required for complex patterns

**The Conflict**: The philosophy demands Mojo for all scripts, but Mojo lacks reliable subprocess error handling
and production-ready regex support.

### Scripts Affected

1. **create_issues.py** (854 LOC)
   - Automates GitHub issue creation via `gh` CLI
   - Requires: stdout capture (issue URLs), exit code checking, retry logic
   - Usage: 20+ subprocess calls with output capture
   - Critical to project workflow

1. **regenerate_github_issues.py** (446 LOC)
   - Generates github_issue.md from plan.md sources
   - Requires: 15+ regex patterns for markdown parsing
   - Critical for maintaining planning hierarchy

1. **create_single_component_issues.py** (197 LOC)
   - Testing utility for issue creation
   - Same requirements as create_issues.py

**Total Impact**: 1,502 lines of production automation code

### Assessment Results

Issue #8's comprehensive testing revealed:

| Capability | Available | Maturity | Risk | Blocks Conversion |
|-----------|-----------|----------|------|-------------------|
| File I/O | Yes | Mature | Low | No |
| Subprocess Exec | Yes | Beta | Medium | No |
| **Subprocess Stdout** | **Partial** | **Beta** | **Medium** | **No** |
| **Exit Code Access** | **NO** | **Missing** | **CRITICAL** | **YES** |
| **Error Detection** | **NO** | **Missing** | **CRITICAL** | **YES** |
| Stderr Capture | Workaround | Alpha | High | No* |
| String Basics | Yes | Mature | Low | No |
| String Methods | Partial | Beta | Medium | No |
| **Regex (stdlib)** | **NO** | **Missing** | **High** | **YES** |
| **Regex (3rd party)** | **Alpha** | **Not Prod-Ready** | **High** | **YES** |
| JSON | Yes | Beta | Medium | No |

**\*** = Workaround exists but increases complexity; **CRITICAL** = Complete blocker for production use

**Estimated Conversion Effort**: 7-9 weeks with low confidence

### ROI Analysis

- Estimated Effort: 7-9 weeks
- Estimated Benefit: Zero (current scripts work perfectly)
- Risk: High (introducing bugs into working system)
- **ROI**: Highly negative

### Decision Drivers

1. **Project Velocity**: Converting working scripts would delay ML implementation by 2-3 months
1. **Risk Management**: High probability of introducing bugs into critical automation
1. **Resource Efficiency**: 7-9 weeks of effort for zero functional benefit
1. **Technical Maturity**: Mojo v0.25.7 is not ready for systems scripting
1. **Pragmatic Engineering**: Use the right tool for each job

## Decision

### Strategic Language Boundaries

We adopt a **Pragmatic Hybrid Approach** with clear boundaries for when to use each language:

#### Mojo REQUIRED

**Core ML/AI Implementation** (Performance-Critical):

- ✅ Neural network implementations (forward/backward passes)
- ✅ Training loops and optimization algorithms
- ✅ Tensor operations and data structures
- ✅ SIMD-optimized kernels
- ✅ Performance-critical data pipelines
- ✅ Custom layer implementations
- ✅ Gradient computation
- ✅ Model inference engines

### New Code Default

- ✅ Any new ML algorithm implementation
- ✅ Any new performance-critical component
- ✅ Any new data processing requiring SIMD
- ✅ Any code where type safety is critical

#### Python ALLOWED

**Automation Requiring Subprocess Output** (Technical Limitation):

- ✅ Scripts calling `gh` CLI that need to capture output
- ✅ Scripts calling external tools requiring stdout/stderr access
- ✅ Scripts requiring command exit code checking
- ✅ CI/CD automation requiring process output

**Regex-Heavy Text Processing** (Technical Limitation):

- ✅ Markdown parsing with complex patterns
- ✅ Configuration file parsing requiring regex
- ✅ Log analysis requiring pattern matching
- ✅ Code generation requiring template substitution

**GitHub API Interaction** (Ecosystem Limitation):

- ✅ Scripts using GitHub CLI (`gh`) for issue/PR management
- ✅ Scripts using GitHub REST API via Python libraries
- ✅ Workflow automation requiring GitHub integration

**Rapid Prototyping** (With Conversion Plan):

- ⚠️ Quick validation scripts (must document Mojo conversion plan)
- ⚠️ One-off debugging utilities (mark as temporary)
- ⚠️ Experimental features (plan migration path)

#### Decision Process

When creating a new component:

1. **What is it?**
   - ML/AI implementation → Mojo (required)
   - Automation/tooling → Check requirements

1. **Does it need subprocess output capture?**
   - Yes → Python (allowed, document why)
   - No → Continue to next check

1. **Does it need regex parsing?**
   - Yes → Python (allowed, document why)
   - No → Continue to next check

1. **Does it interface with Python-only libraries?**
   - Yes → Python (allowed, document why)
   - No → **Mojo (required)**

1. **Document the decision** in code comments and issue notes

### Justification Requirements

### For Python Usage in Automation

All Python automation scripts MUST include a header comment explaining the justification:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

"""
Script: create_issues.py
Purpose: Automate GitHub issue creation via gh CLI

Language: Python
Justification:
  - Requires subprocess stdout capture to get issue URLs from gh CLI
  - Mojo v0.25.7 subprocess module cannot capture output (blocking limitation)
  - Uses 15+ regex patterns for markdown parsing (no Mojo regex support)

Conversion Plan:
  - Monitor Mojo releases for subprocess output capture support
  - Reassess quarterly (see ADR-001 monitoring strategy)
  - Target conversion: Q2-Q3 2026 (estimated)

Reference: ADR-001, Issue #8
"""
```text

### For New Python Code

Any new Python code MUST have an associated GitHub issue documenting:

- Why Python is required (technical limitation, ecosystem, etc.)
- What Mojo capabilities are blocking conversion
- When the decision will be reassessed
- Link to this ADR

### Update to CLAUDE.md

The "Language Preference" section in CLAUDE.md will be updated to reflect this decision:

```markdown
### Language Preference

#### Mojo First - With Pragmatic Exceptions

**Default to Mojo** for ALL new ML/AI code:

- ✅ Neural network implementations
- ✅ Training loops and optimization
- ✅ Tensor operations and SIMD kernels
- ✅ Performance-critical data processing
- ✅ Type-safe model components

**Use Python for Automation** when technical limitations require it:

- ✅ Subprocess output capture (Mojo limitation in v0.25.7)
- ✅ Regex-heavy text processing (no Mojo regex support)
- ✅ GitHub API interaction via Python libraries
- ⚠️ Must document justification (see ADR-001)

**Rule of Thumb**:

- ML/AI implementation? → Mojo (required)
- Automation needing subprocess output? → Python (allowed)
- Automation needing regex? → Python (allowed)
- Everything else? → Mojo (default)

**See**: ADR-001 for complete language selection strategy
```text

### Update to Chief Architect Guidelines

The "Language Selection Strategy" section in chief-architect.md will be updated:

```markdown
### Language Selection Strategy

**Mojo Required**:

- ALL ML/AI implementations (neural networks, training, inference)
- ALL performance-critical code (SIMD kernels, tensor ops)
- ALL new code unless technical limitation documented

**Python Allowed**:

- Automation requiring subprocess output capture (Mojo v0.25.7 limitation)
- Text processing requiring regex (no Mojo stdlib support)
- GitHub API interaction via Python libraries
- Must document justification per ADR-001

**Decision Authority**:

- Chief Architect approves new Python automation
- All Python usage must link to this ADR or have issue documenting justification
- Quarterly reviews of Python code for conversion opportunities

**See**: ADR-001 for monitoring strategy and reassessment criteria
```text

## Rationale

### Why Hybrid Over Pure Mojo

### Technical Feasibility

- Mojo v0.25.7 cannot capture subprocess output (confirmed by Issue #8 testing)
- No Mojo stdlib regex support (confirmed by documentation review)
- Workarounds (Python interop) defeat the purpose of conversion
- Manual parsing alternatives are high-risk and time-consuming

### Engineering Economics

- 7-9 weeks conversion effort vs. 0 functional benefit
- High risk of introducing bugs in critical automation
- Delays ML implementation (the actual project goal)
- Python scripts are battle-tested and reliable

### Strategic Focus

- Project goal is ML research implementation, not language purity
- Mojo's value is in ML performance, not scripting convenience
- Python excels at automation and tooling
- Use each language where it provides the most value

### Why This Decision Is Strategic, Not Tactical

This is an **architectural decision** affecting the entire project:

1. **Defines Language Boundaries**: Clear rules for when to use each language
1. **Establishes Patterns**: Template for future technology decisions
1. **Prioritizes Project Goals**: ML implementation over tooling consistency
1. **Plans for Future**: Monitoring and reassessment strategy
1. **Balances Pragmatism with Vision**: Keeps Mojo focus where it matters

This is not a one-off exception—it's a strategic framework for technology selection.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

### Immediate Benefits

- ✅ Project can proceed without 2-3 month delay
- ✅ Reliable automation scripts remain stable
- ✅ Team can focus on ML implementation (actual project goal)
- ✅ Risk of bugs in critical tooling eliminated
- ✅ Clear decision framework for future choices

### Long-Term Benefits

- ✅ Pragmatic approach attracts contributors
- ✅ Flexibility to adapt as Mojo matures
- ✅ Each language used for its strengths
- ✅ Quarterly reviews ensure continuous improvement
- ✅ Documented rationale for all decisions

### Strategic Benefits

- ✅ Demonstrates mature engineering judgment
- ✅ Prioritizes project outcomes over ideology
- ✅ Establishes pattern for future technology decisions
- ✅ Shows understanding of tool limitations

### Negative Consequences

### Technical Debt

- ⚠️ Two languages to maintain (Python + Mojo)
- ⚠️ Potential for inconsistent patterns across languages
- ⚠️ Learning curve for contributors
- ⚠️ Future conversion work when Mojo matures

### Mitigation Strategy

- Clear boundaries prevent confusion
- Quarterly reviews minimize conversion effort
- Documentation ensures consistency
- Monitoring strategy tracks Mojo progress

### Philosophical Inconsistency

- ⚠️ Appears to violate "Mojo First" principle
- ⚠️ May confuse contributors about language choice

### Mitigation Strategy

- Update documentation to clarify boundaries
- ADR provides clear justification
- Decision process guides contributors
- "Mojo First for ML" is the actual principle

### Monitoring Overhead

- ⚠️ Quarterly reviews require time
- ⚠️ Tracking Mojo releases for features

### Mitigation Strategy

- Lightweight monitoring (check changelog)
- Only test when relevant features added
- Community forums provide early signals

### Trade-offs Accepted

We explicitly accept these trade-offs:

1. **Two languages** instead of one → But each used appropriately
1. **Future conversion work** → But only when Mojo is ready
1. **Philosophical inconsistency** → But pragmatic and data-driven
1. **Monitoring overhead** → But ensures timely conversion

These trade-offs are **preferable** to:

- 2-3 month delay in ML implementation
- High risk of bugs in critical automation
- Wasted effort on impossible conversion
- Ideological purity at expense of project success

## Future Considerations

### If Mojo Capabilities Mature

While Python is the right choice today, Mojo's subprocess and regex capabilities may improve in the future.
**Reassessment should only occur if ALL of the following become available**:

**Critical Requirements** (must ALL be present):

1. **Exit Code Access**:
   - subprocess API returns exit codes
   - Non-zero exits can be detected and handled
   - No silent failures on command errors

1. **Reliable Error Handling**:
   - Exceptions raised on subprocess failures
   - stderr capture available independently
   - Timeout and error handling mechanisms

1. **Production-Ready Regex**:
   - Native stdlib regex module, OR
   - Mature third-party library with compile(), findall(), sub()
   - Documented, stable, and widely adopted

### Decision Process If Requirements Met

1. **Validate** with updated test suite (`test_mojo_capabilities.mojo`)
1. **Assess** conversion effort for highest-impact scripts
1. **Compare** effort vs. benefit (likely still minimal benefit)
1. **Document** findings in new ADR if conversion is warranted

**Current Stance**: Python automation is the permanent solution until Mojo fundamentally changes its subprocess
and regex support. No active monitoring planned - reassessment only if Mojo announces major scripting improvements.

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Pure Mojo with Python Interop

**Approach**: Write scripts in Mojo, call Python subprocess module via interop

### Pros

- Maintains "Mojo First" principle
- Learning experience for team
- Could work technically

### Cons

- Defeats the purpose (still dependent on Python)
- Adds complexity (Mojo + Python interop layer)
- No performance benefit (bottlenecked by Python)
- More brittle (interop can break)
- Harder to maintain

**Why Rejected**: Adds complexity without benefits. If we're calling Python anyway, use Python directly.

### Alternative 2: Wait for Mojo to Mature

**Approach**: Pause all automation work until Mojo supports required capabilities

### Pros

- Eventually achieves "Mojo First" goal
- No technical debt
- One language eventually

### Cons

- 6-12 month delay (unacceptable)
- Project cannot proceed
- ML implementation blocked
- No guarantee of timeline
- Existing Python scripts sit unused

**Why Rejected**: Unacceptable project delay. Current scripts work perfectly.

### Alternative 3: Partial Conversion

**Approach**: Convert simple scripts, keep complex ones in Python

### Pros

- Learning experience
- Some progress toward Mojo
- Proves feasibility for simple cases

### Cons

- Doesn't solve the main problems
- Wastes time on non-critical work
- Same limitations apply to complex scripts
- Creates inconsistency
- No clear benefit

**Why Rejected**: Wastes effort on low-value work. Focus on ML implementation instead.

### Alternative 4: Abandon Python Scripts, Build New Mojo Workflow

**Approach**: Design new workflow that works within Mojo limitations

### Pros

- Pure Mojo solution
- Opportunity to redesign workflow
- No Python dependency

### Cons

- Requires redesigning GitHub integration
- No way to get issue URLs without subprocess output
- Would need to manually track issues
- Massive engineering effort
- Lower reliability than current system

**Why Rejected**: Infeasible without subprocess output. Can't integrate with GitHub CLI.

### Alternative 5: Hybrid Approach (SELECTED)

**Approach**: Python for automation, Mojo for ML/AI implementation

### Pros

- No project delay
- Uses each language appropriately
- Maintains working automation
- Allows focus on ML implementation
- Pragmatic and data-driven
- Clear decision framework

### Cons

- Two languages to maintain
- Future conversion work
- Philosophical inconsistency

**Why Selected**: Best balance of pragmatism, project velocity, and strategic focus. Allows immediate progress
while planning for future.
