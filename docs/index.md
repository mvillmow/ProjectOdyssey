# ML Odyssey Documentation

Welcome to ML Odyssey - a Mojo-based AI research platform for reproducing classic machine learning papers.

## Overview

ML Odyssey is designed to reproduce seminal machine learning research papers using Mojo, a high-performance
language optimized for AI/ML workloads. The project combines modern software engineering practices with
cutting-edge performance optimization to create reference implementations of classic papers.
