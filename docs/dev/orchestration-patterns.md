# Orchestration Patterns and Delegation Rules

## Overview

This document defines how agents coordinate, delegate tasks, and escalate issues within the 6-level hierarchy.
Effective orchestration is critical for the multi-level agent system to function smoothly.

## Core Principles

1. **Clear Scope Boundaries**: Each level has well-defined scope
1. **Explicit Delegation**: Higher levels delegate specific tasks
1. **Horizontal Coordination**: Same-level agents coordinate directly
1. **Vertical Escalation**: Issues bubble up when unresolvable
1. **Status Transparency**: All agents report progress clearly

## Delegation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Decomposition Delegation

**When**: Large task needs to be broken into smaller pieces
**How**: Higher level analyzes task → Creates subtasks → Delegates to lower levels

```text
Chief Architect Agent
  ↓ Decompose repository into sections
Section Orchestrators (6 sections)
  ↓ Decompose sections into modules
Module Design Agents
  ↓ Decompose modules into components
Component Specialists
  ↓ Decompose components into functions
Implementation Engineers
```text

### Example

```text
Task: "Implement LeNet-5 paper"

Chief Architect:

  - Analyzes paper requirements
  - Delegates to Paper Implementation Orchestrator

Paper Implementation Orchestrator:

  - Breaks into: data prep, model impl, training, eval
  - Delegates each to Module Design Agents

Architecture Design Agent:

  - Designs model architecture
  - Delegates component implementation to Senior Implementation Specialist

Senior Implementation Specialist:

  - Breaks into classes: Conv2D, Pool, Dense layers
  - Delegates each class to Implementation Engineers
```text

### Pattern 2: Specialization Delegation

**When**: Task requires specific expertise
**How**: Orchestrator identifies expertise needed → Delegates to specialist agent

```text
Section Orchestrator
  ├─> Architecture Design Agent (for architecture tasks)
  ├─> Security Design Agent (for security tasks)
  └─> Integration Design Agent (for integration tasks)
```text

### Example

```text
Task: "Implement secure API authentication"

Section Orchestrator:

  - Identifies security expertise needed
  - Delegates to Security Design Agent

Security Design Agent:

  - Designs authentication approach
  - Delegates to Security Implementation Specialist

Security Implementation Specialist:

  - Implements auth logic
  - Delegates code generation to Implementation Engineer
```text

### Pattern 3: Parallel Delegation

**When**: Independent tasks can run simultaneously
**How**: Orchestrator delegates multiple tasks in parallel to different agents

```text
Section Orchestrator
  ├─> Module Design Agent A (parallel)
  ├─> Module Design Agent B (parallel)
  └─> Module Design Agent C (parallel)
```text

**Example** (5-Phase Workflow):

```text
After Plan phase completes:

Component Specialist delegates in parallel to:
  ├─> Test Engineer (create tests)
  ├─> Implementation Engineer (write code)
  └─> Documentation Writer (write docs)

All three work simultaneously in separate worktrees
```text

### Pattern 4: Sequential Delegation

**When**: Tasks have dependencies
**How**: Orchestrator delegates tasks in sequence, waiting for completion

```text
Section Orchestrator
  Step 1 ↓ Delegate to Agent A
        ↓ Wait for completion
  Step 2 ↓ Delegate to Agent B
        ↓ Wait for completion
  Step 3 ↓ Delegate to Agent C
```text

### Example

```text
Plan Phase must complete before Test/Impl/Package:

1. Section Orchestrator → Architecture Design Agent (Plan)

   ↓ Wait for plan.md completion
2. Section Orchestrator → Component Specialists (Test/Impl/Package)

   ↓ Specialists work in parallel
3. Section Orchestrator → All agents (Cleanup)

```text

## Coordination Patterns

### Horizontal Coordination (Same Level)

#### Pattern: Peer Review

**Scenario**: Agents review each other's work

```text
Implementation Engineer A <──review──> Implementation Engineer B
```text

#### Process

1. Engineer A completes implementation
1. Engineer A requests review from Engineer B
1. Engineer B reviews code, provides feedback
1. Engineer A addresses feedback
1. Both sign off on completion

#### Pattern: Interface Negotiation

**Scenario**: Agents need to agree on shared interfaces

```text
Module Design Agent A <──negotiate──> Module Design Agent B
```text

#### Interface Negotiation Process

1. Agent A designs module A interface
1. Agent B designs module B interface
1. Both identify integration points
1. Negotiate API contracts
1. Document agreed interfaces
1. Proceed with implementation

#### Pattern: Resource Coordination

**Scenario**: Multiple agents need same resource

```text
Engineer A ─┐
           ├──> Shared Resource (file, database, etc.)
Engineer B ─┘
```text

#### Resource Coordination Process

1. Engineers identify shared resource
1. Coordinate timing to avoid conflicts
1. Use git worktrees for file isolation
1. Communicate through status updates
1. Merge changes carefully

### Vertical Coordination (Across Levels)

#### Pattern: Status Reporting

**Scenario**: Lower level reports progress to higher level

```text
Implementation Engineer
  ↓ Status Report
Component Specialist
  ↓ Aggregated Status
Module Design Agent
  ↓ Summary Report
Section Orchestrator
```text

#### Report Format

```markdown
## Status Report

**Agent**: Implementation Engineer - Database Module
**Date**: 2025-11-07
**Phase**: Implementation
**Progress**: 75% complete

### Completed

- User authentication functions
- Database connection pooling
- Error handling

### In Progress

- Query optimization
- Connection retry logic

### Blockers

- None

### Next Steps

- Complete retry logic
- Write unit tests
- Request code review

```text

#### Pattern: Specification Cascade

**Scenario**: Higher level provides specifications to lower level

```text
Module Design Agent
  ↓ Component Specification
Component Specialist
  ↓ Function Specification
Implementation Engineer
  ↓ Code Implementation
```text

#### Specification Format

```markdown
## Component Specification: UserAuth

Purpose: Handle user authentication and session management

Inputs:

- username: string
- password: string

Outputs:

- auth_token: string
- user_id: int

Functions Required:

1. authenticate_user(username, password) -> auth_token
2. validate_token(auth_token) -> bool
3. refresh_token(auth_token) -> new_auth_token

Error Handling:

- InvalidCredentials exception
- TokenExpired exception
- DatabaseConnectionError exception

Performance Requirements:

- Authentication: < 100ms
- Token validation: < 10ms

Security Requirements:

- Password hashing: bcrypt with cost 12
- Token: JWT with HS256
- Session timeout: 30 minutes

```text

---

## Escalation Patterns

### Pattern: Blocker Escalation

**When**: Agent cannot proceed due to external blocker
**How**: Escalate to next level up

```text
Implementation Engineer (blocked)
  ↓ Escalate blocker
Component Specialist
  ├─> Can resolve? → Resolve and respond
  └─> Cannot resolve? → Escalate to Module Design Agent
```text

### Example

```text
Blocker: "Database schema not defined"

Implementation Engineer:

  - Cannot implement without schema
  - Escalates to Component Specialist

Component Specialist:

  - Recognizes this is architectural issue
  - Escalates to Architecture Design Agent

Architecture Design Agent:

  - Designs database schema
  - Provides specification
  - Issue resolved, work continues
```text

### Pattern: Conflict Escalation

**When**: Agents disagree on approach
**How**: Escalate to common superior

```text
Agent A (disagrees) ──┐
                      ├──> Common Superior (decides)
Agent B (disagrees) ──┘
```text

### Example

```text
Conflict: Choice of data structure (list vs dict)

Implementation Engineer A: "Use list for performance"
Implementation Engineer B: "Use dict for lookups"

Both escalate to:
  Component Specialist
    - Reviews requirements
    - Analyzes trade-offs
    - Decides: "Use dict, lookups more important"
    - Provides rationale
    - Both engineers implement decision
```text

### Pattern: Quality Escalation

**When**: Quality issues detected that violate standards
**How**: Escalate for review and correction

```text
Test Engineer (detects failures)
  ↓ Report quality issue
Component Specialist
  ↓ Assigns correction
Implementation Engineer
  ↓ Fixes issues
Test Engineer (verifies fix)
```text

---

## Workflow Integration

### 5-Phase Workflow Orchestration

#### Phase 1: Plan (Sequential)

```text
Chief Architect
  ↓ Strategic planning
Section Orchestrators
  ↓ Tactical planning
Module Design Agents
  ↓ Component design
Component Specialists
  ↓ Detailed specifications
```text

**Completion Criteria**: All plan.md files (local, task-relative) created and reviewed

#### Phase 2-4: Test/Implementation/Packaging (Parallel)

```text
Component Specialist
  ├─> Test Specialist → Test Engineers (parallel)
  ├─> Implementation Specialist → Implementation Engineers (parallel)
  └─> Documentation Specialist → Documentation Writers (parallel)
```text

**Coordination**: TDD approach - tests and implementation coordinate

#### Phase 5: Cleanup (Sequential)

```text
All agents review their own work
  ↓ Identify issues
Component Specialists
  ↓ Aggregate issues
Section Orchestrators
  ↓ Prioritize cleanup
All agents
  ↓ Execute cleanup tasks
```text

---

## Git Worktree Coordination

### Worktree Assignment

Each issue = one worktree

```text
issue-62-plan-agents/          → Architecture Design Agent
issue-63-test-agents/          → Test Design Specialist
issue-64-impl-agents/          → Implementation Specialists
issue-65-pkg-agents/           → Documentation Specialist
issue-66-cleanup-agents/       → All agents
```text

### Cross-Worktree Coordination

#### Scenario: Implementation needs test fixtures from Test worktree

#### Option 1: Cherry-pick commits

```bash
cd worktrees/issue-64-impl-agents
git cherry-pick abc123  # Pick test fixture commit
```text

#### Option 2: Temporary merge

```bash
cd worktrees/issue-64-impl-agents
git merge --no-commit issue-63-test-agents

# Use merged state

git reset --hard  # Clean up if needed
```text

#### Option 3: Coordinate through specifications

```text
Test Engineer: Commits test fixtures to issue-63 branch
Implementation Engineer: Reads specifications (local plan.md or tracked docs) for fixture specs
Implementation Engineer: Creates fixtures independently in issue-64
After both complete: Package Engineer merges both
```text

**Note**: plan.md files are task-relative. For team-wide coordination, use
tracked documentation in notes/issues/.

---

## Communication Protocols

### Status Updates

**Frequency**: After completing each major task
**Format**: Structured status report (see above)
**Destination**: Direct superior in hierarchy

### Handoffs

**When**: Completing work and passing to next agent

#### Format

```markdown
## Task Handoff

From: [Agent Name]
To: [Next Agent Name]
Date: [Date]

Work Completed:

- [List of completed items]

Artifacts Produced:

- [File paths and descriptions]

Next Steps:

- [What the next agent should do]

Notes:

- [Any important context or caveats]

Questions for Next Agent:

- [Any clarifications needed]

```text

### Blockers

**When**: Immediately when discovered

#### Format

```markdown
## Blocker Report

Agent: [Your Name]
Task: [What you're working on]
Blocker: [What's blocking you]
Impact: [How this affects timeline]
Attempted Solutions: [What you've tried]
Escalation To: [Who should resolve this]
Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
```text

---

## Decision-Making Rules

### Decision Authority by Level

| Level | Can Decide | Must Escalate |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| 0 | System-wide architecture, technology stack | Strategic business decisions |
| 1 | Section architecture, module organization | Cross-section conflicts |
| 2 | Module design, component interfaces | Section-wide impacts |
| 3 | Component implementation approach | Module-wide changes |
| 4 | Function implementation details | Component-wide refactoring |
| 5 | Code formatting, variable naming | Function-level decisions |

### Escalation Triggers

Escalate when:

1. **Scope Exceeds Authority**: Decision impacts levels above
1. **Resource Conflicts**: Multiple agents need same resource
1. **Timeline Issues**: Work blocked or significantly delayed
1. **Quality Concerns**: Standards violated or quality at risk
1. **Technical Disagreements**: Agents cannot reach consensus
1. **Requirements Unclear**: Specifications incomplete or contradictory

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)

### ❌ Skipping Levels

**Wrong**: Junior Engineer escalates directly to Chief Architect
**Right**: Junior Engineer → Implementation Engineer → Component Specialist → ... → Chief Architect

### ❌ Micro-Management

**Wrong**: Section Orchestrator specifies function implementations
**Right**: Section Orchestrator specifies requirements, delegates implementation details

### ❌ Working in Silos

**Wrong**: Agents work without communicating, merge conflicts arise
**Right**: Agents coordinate on interfaces, share status, negotiate conflicts

### ❌ Hoarding Information

**Wrong**: Agent completes work without documenting decisions
**Right**: Agent documents rationale, shares learnings, updates specs

### ❌ Premature Optimization

**Wrong**: Junior Engineer refactors entire codebase
**Right**: Junior Engineer implements spec, suggests optimizations to superior

---

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Health Metrics

- **Delegation Depth**: Average levels traversed per task
- **Escalation Rate**: Number of escalations per 100 tasks
- **Cycle Time**: Time from delegation to completion
- **Rework Rate**: Tasks returned for corrections
- **Coordination Overhead**: Time spent on coordination vs execution

### Success Indicators

- Clear task handoffs
- Minimal escalations for trivial issues
- High first-time quality
- Effective parallel execution
- Smooth cross-worktree coordination

## Examples

### Example 1: Complete Task Flow

**Task**: "Implement user authentication"

```text
1. Chief Architect
   - Recognizes security importance
   - Delegates to Foundation Orchestrator

2. Foundation Orchestrator
   - Assigns to Security Design Agent

3. Security Design Agent (Level 2)
   - Designs authentication approach
   - Creates component specification
   - Delegates to Security Implementation Specialist

4. Security Implementation Specialist (Level 3)
   - Breaks into functions
   - Creates detailed implementation plan
   - Delegates in parallel:
     ├─> Test Engineer (write tests)
     ├─> Implementation Engineer (write code)
     └─> Documentation Writer (write docs)

5. Implementation Engineer (Level 4)
   - Implements authentication functions
   - Coordinates with Test Engineer on TDD
   - Delegates boilerplate to Junior Engineer

6. Junior Engineer (Level 5)
   - Generates function templates
   - Applies code formatters
   - Returns to Implementation Engineer

7. Implementation Engineer
   - Completes implementation
   - Reports to Security Implementation Specialist

8. Security Implementation Specialist
   - Reviews all work (test, impl, docs)
   - Integrates in packaging worktree
   - Reports to Security Design Agent

9. Security Design Agent
   - Validates against design
   - Reports to Foundation Orchestrator

10. Foundation Orchestrator
    - Confirms completion
    - Updates Chief Architect
```text

### Example 2: Conflict Resolution

**Conflict**: Test Engineer and Implementation Engineer disagree on function signature

```text
1. Test Engineer: "Function should return tuple (success, user_id)"
2. Implementation Engineer: "Function should return user_id or raise exception"

3. Both escalate to Component Specialist

4. Component Specialist:
   - Reviews Python best practices
   - Analyzes use cases
   - Decides: "Raise exception on failure, return user_id on success"
   - Rationale: "Pythonic, clearer error handling"
   - Updates specification

5. Both engineers implement decision
6. Test Engineer updates tests
7. Implementation Engineer updates code
8. Conflict resolved

```text

## Error Handling & Recovery

This section defines how orchestrators and all agents handle errors, blockers, and failures. All orchestrators
should reference this section rather than duplicating content.

### Error Categories

**Transient Errors** (retry-able):

- GitHub API rate limits
- Network timeouts
- File locks
- Temporary resource unavailability

**Permanent Errors** (escalate):

- Missing dependencies
- Invalid specifications
- Conflicting requirements
- Design flaws

**Agent Errors** (recover or escalate):

- Delegated agent fails to complete task
- Delegated agent reports blocker
- Specification ambiguity
- Resource conflicts between agents

### Error Handling Protocol

#### Step 1: Detect

- Monitor task completion status
- Check for error messages in agent outputs
- Validate deliverables exist and are correct
- Track timeouts and delays

#### Step 2: Classify

- **Transient**: Can retry automatically
- **Recoverable**: Need adjustment, not escalation
- **Blocker**: Must escalate to superior

#### Step 3: Respond

### For Transient Errors

1. Wait with exponential backoff
1. Retry up to 3 times
1. If still failing, reclassify as blocker

### For Recoverable Errors

1. Clarify specification
1. Provide additional context
1. Re-delegate with improved instructions
1. Document lesson learned in `/notes/issues/<issue-number>/README.md`

### For Blockers

1. Document what's blocked and impact
1. Document what you've tried
1. Escalate to immediate superior with clear report
1. Continue with non-blocked tasks if possible

### Escalation Report Format

```markdown
## Escalation Report

**From**: [Your Agent Name/Level]
**To**: [Superior Agent Name/Level]
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Issue**: [Brief summary]

### What's Blocked

- [Specific task or deliverable]

### Root Cause

- [What caused the blocker]

### What I've Tried

1. [Attempt 1] - [Result]
2. [Attempt 2] - [Result]
3. [Attempt 3] - [Result]

### Impact

- Timeline: [X days delayed]
- Dependencies: [What other tasks are blocked]
- Scope: [Can we proceed with other work?]

### Recommended Action

- [Your suggestion for resolution]
```text

### Recovery Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Specification Refinement

- Agent reports ambiguity in task specification
- Orchestrator clarifies and provides more detail
- Agent proceeds with refined spec

#### Strategy 2: Resource Reallocation

- Agent reports resource conflict (file, API, etc.)
- Orchestrator coordinates timing with other agents
- Work proceeds in sequence instead of parallel

#### Strategy 3: Scope Reduction

- Task proves too complex for current approach
- Orchestrator breaks into smaller subtasks
- Delegates simpler pieces to agents

#### Strategy 4: Agent Substitution

- Delegated agent lacks capability
- Orchestrator identifies appropriate specialist
- Re-delegates to agent with right expertise

#### Strategy 5: Escalation for Authority

- Decision requires higher-level authority
- Document options and trade-offs
- Escalate with recommendation
- Superior makes decision, orchestrator implements

### Continuous Improvement

After resolving errors:

1. **Document** the error and resolution in `/notes/issues/<issue-number>/README.md`
1. **Update** specifications to prevent recurrence
1. **Share** lessons with peer agents (if applicable)
1. **Improve** delegation instructions for future tasks

### GitHub Issue Requirement

**All work requires a GitHub issue**. If an error occurs and no issue exists:

1. **STOP** work immediately
1. **Create issue** using `gh issue create` or escalate to have issue created
1. **Document** error in `/notes/issues/<issue-number>/README.md`
1. **Resume** work after issue is created

No outputs should be created outside `/notes/issues/<issue-number>/` directory.
