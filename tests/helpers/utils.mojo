"""Test utilities for ExTensor testing.

Provides utility functions for test setup, debugging, and validation.

# TODO(#2734): Implement utility functions once needed
# These might include:
# - print_tensor(tensor) - Pretty-print tensor for debugging
# - tensor_summary(tensor) - Print shape, dtype, min/max/mean
# - compare_tensors(a, b) - Detailed comparison for debugging failures
# - benchmark(fn, iterations) - Simple performance testing helper

# Placeholder for now - will be implemented as needed
