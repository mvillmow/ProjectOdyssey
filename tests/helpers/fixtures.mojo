"""Test fixtures for ExTensor testing.

Provides common tensor creation utilities for tests, including
random tensors, sequential tensors, and special value tensors.

FIXME(#2715): Multiple placeholder fixture functions require implementation:
- random_tensor(shape, dtype) -> ExTensor
- sequential_tensor(shape, dtype) -> ExTensor
- nan_tensor(shape) -> ExTensor
- inf_tensor(shape) -> ExTensor
- ones_like(tensor) -> ExTensor
- zeros_like(tensor) -> ExTensor
These will be implemented once ExTensor is fully functional.
See Issue #49 for details

# TODO: Implement fixture functions once ExTensor is fully functional
# These will include:
# - random_tensor(shape, dtype) -> ExTensor
# - sequential_tensor(shape, dtype) -> ExTensor  # 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
# - nan_tensor(shape) -> ExTensor  # All NaN values
# - inf_tensor(shape) -> ExTensor  # All infinity values
# - ones_like(tensor) -> ExTensor
# - zeros_like(tensor) -> ExTensor

# Placeholder for now - will be implemented as ExTensor matures
