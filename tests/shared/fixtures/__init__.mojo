"""Shared test fixtures for ML Odyssey test suite.

This module provides comprehensive test utilities including:
- Mock tensor creation and comparison utilities
- Mock datasets and data loaders
- Mock model architectures for testing (now consolidated in shared.testing)
- File I/O helpers for temporary files
- Configuration fixtures for validation testing

All fixtures follow these principles:
- Simple and concrete implementations (no complex mocking)
- Deterministic behavior with fixed seeds
- Clear, documented APIs
- Minimal dependencies

Usage:
    from tests.shared.fixtures.mock_tensors import create_random_tensor
    from tests.shared.fixtures.mock_data import MockDataset
    from shared.testing import SimpleMLP  # Models now consolidated in shared.testing

Note on consolidation:
    The SimpleMLP and other test model definitions have been consolidated
    into shared.testing.test_models for better organization. Test files
    should import test models from shared.testing instead of from this module.
    For backward compatibility, mock_models.mojo re-exports from the
    consolidated location, but direct imports from shared.testing are preferred.

See individual modules for detailed documentation and examples.
